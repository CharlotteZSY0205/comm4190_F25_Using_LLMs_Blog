    "title": "Introducing The First Extension I Developed: Prompt Booster",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What is Prompt Booster and why was it designed?\nPrompt Booster was created to help users get more out of their interactions with AI. Too often, prompts are either too shallow (outsourcing all the thinking to the AI) or too generic (leading to weak or superficial responses). Prompt Booster solves this problem by automatically enhancing prompts before they’re sent with one click, giving users a smoother and quicker way to achieve richer, more reliable outputs.\n\n\n\n\nTwo Core Features\n\nPrompt Boost Users can ask Prompt Booster to improve their prompts in ways that fit their goals. For example:\n\nTransform a vague request into a comprehensive and evidence-based prompt that encourages ChatGPT to provide well-supported, verifiable responses.\nReframe a lazy or over-reliant prompt into one that guides the user to complete the task themselves, rather than asking the AI to do all the work.\nEncourage deeper reflection or critical thinking by automatically rewriting prompts to push the AI toward more analytical or thought-provoking answers.\n\nPrompt Append With a single click, users can add predefined, repeatable requirements to any new input. This saves time and ensures consistency across different tasks. For example:\n\nTranslate: Translate the above text into natural, fluent English that reads as if written by a native speaker.\nPolish: Polish and refine the language to make it smoother, more professional, and stylistically consistent.\nSummarize: Summarize the content clearly and concisely, highlighting the key points in a structured way.\nSimplify: Rewrite this paragraph so it is easier to understand, using simpler words and clearer sentence structures.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Get Started with Prompt Booster\n\n1. Install & Connect\nFirst things first—get Prompt Booster onto your browser.\n\nAdd Prompt Booster to Chrome and pin it to your toolbar so it’s always just one click away.\nOpen the settings page (look for the little gear) and paste in your API key.\nNot sure where to find your API key? No problem—here’s a quick guide that walks you through it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the main interface of the software. In terms of visual design, I made the buttons consistent with ChatGPT’s own buttons to achieve a clean and sophisticated style. I chose purple as the primary color—not only because it conveys a sense of elegance, but also because of my personal connection to my undergraduate alma mater, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, where purple is one of the theme colors in its emblem. I also added a gear button so that users can quickly access the plugin’s settings. Otherwise, using Chrome’s built-in method would be too cumbersome, since users would have to click Extension, then More Options, and finally Options.\n\n\n\n2. Configure Your Prompt Modes\nThis is where the fun begins—you can customize Prompt Booster to work exactly the way you want.\n\nGo to My Prompts to create or edit both Boost Prompts and Append Prompts.\nDrag and drop them around with the three-line icon to reorder.\nPro tip: the top three prompts become quick-access buttons right in your ChatGPT input box, so keep your favorites up there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoost Mode: Smarten Up Your Prompts\nEver typed something vague into ChatGPT and wished it came out sharper, deeper, or more structured? That’s exactly what Boost Mode is for.\n\nJust tap the Boost button from the quick options.\nHit the Prompt Boost button or press ⌥/Alt + Enter to instantly upgrade your prompt.\nIf you enable Prompt Review, you’ll see your original vs. boosted prompt side by side—super handy for comparing.\nYou can choose Use Original or Use Boosted, or just press ⌥/Alt + Enter again to send whichever you like.\nNot quite there yet? Click Reboost to spin up another optimized version until it feels right.\n\n\n \n\n\nHere I added a Prompt Review feature that lets users compare their original prompt with the revised one. On the one hand, this gives them the option to still use their own prompt. On the other hand, it allows them to see what the revised prompt looks like, making it more likely they’ll use it as a reference to learn how to craft more effective or better-tailored prompts. To prevent situations where users are dissatisfied with the revised prompt, I also added a Reboost function, which lets them request another revision. I also added keyboard shortcuts. At first, the shortcut for sending a prompt modified by Prompt Booster was Enter. But during my own use, I realized I don’t always need Prompt Booster. So I kept Enter for sending my original prompt, and added Option + Enter for sending the boosted version in the selected mode. This way, users stay in control while still having the quickest way to use Prompt Booster.\n\n\n\nAppend Mode: Add Your Personal Touch\nSometimes you don’t want your whole prompt rewritten—you just want to make sure a certain instruction always gets added. That’s where Append Mode shines.\n\nSelect Append from the quick buttons.\nClick Prompt Boost or press ⌥/Alt + Enter—your input goes through exactly as written, but with your chosen “append rules” automatically tacked on.\n\n\n \n\n✨ And that’s it—you’re ready to roll! With Prompt Booster, you can choose between fully boosting your prompt for depth and quality or simply appending your go-to rules with a single click.\nYour prompts, your way—just smarter.\n\nNext, I’m going to collaborate with Nano Banana to create the logo for this extension, and I’ll also submit it for review and try to publish it so that it can actually be used by the public.\n\n````"

    "title": "ChatGPT Study Mode: Testing Its Pedagogical Promise",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Many studies have found that college students often turn to ChatGPT to write their essays. So when ChatGPT launched its new Study Mode, I couldn’t help but wonder: can it really resist the temptation of a “Write my essay” prompt—and actually teach students how to write better?\n\n\n\n\n“When students engage with study mode, they’re met with guiding questions that calibrate responses to their objective and skill level to help them build deeper understanding. Study mode is designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help students learn something—not just finish something.” — OpenAI, ChatGPT Study Mode\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experiment grew out of one of my research projects on how students use ChatGPT in writing. For the study, I selected 21 prompts from the RECIPE4U dataset — a publicly available collection of interaction histories between 212 college students and ChatGPT in an English writing course (Sawalha et al., 2024a).\nIn that course, students used ChatGPT to help revise their essays, and the dataset records their entire conversations, including the original prompts, dialogue exchanges, annotated writing intentions, and final revised essays. Using a subset of these authentic prompts, I tested ChatGPT’s Study Mode to see how well it supports learning-oriented writing guidance compared with ordinary prompts.\n\n\n\n\nThe 21 prompts we selected were all labeled “Content Generation.” Based on both my classroom observations and prior research, many college students tend to use ChatGPT primarily to generate essays directly rather than to learn or revise through it.\nI wanted to test whether ChatGPT’s Study Mode could truly support learning and knowledge transformation—as it claims to—rather than simply producing finished text. To do this, I took those prompts that originally requested direct generation and ran them in ChatGPT’s Study Mode.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, to my disappointment, 14 out of 21 responses directly produced ready-made text, just as the users originally requested. Here are some examples.\n\n\n\nPrompt from the dataset:\n\nCan you rewrite the body paragraph by breaking up the body paragraphs into subheadings. {the student’s essay}.\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nGood — before I rewrite anything, let’s make sure you understand why and how subheadings help.\nSubheadings give readers “signposts” so they can easily follow the structure of your essay. Each main idea (like Convenience, Affordability, Health Problems, etc.) becomes its own section.\nLet’s try this step-by-step. Your essay’s body paragraphs seem to focus on three big ideas:\n\nConvenience of Fast Food\nAffordability and Accessibility\nNegative Health and Social Effects\n\n\nHere’s a sample outline of how those subheadings could look — not rewritten yet, just organized:\n\n\n\n\nExplain how location, opening hours, and speed make fast food easy to access.\n\n\n\nDescribe why fast food is cheap — simple menus, pre-packaged ingredients, low overhead — and how it helps people on tight budgets.\n\n\n\nDiscuss obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, then mention environmental and economic impacts.\n\nNow, here’s your task: Can you tell me which tone you’d like for the rewritten version — a) academic essay style (formal, polished, transitions like furthermore, moreover) or b) clear student essay style (simple and natural, easy to read)?\nI said:\n\nacademic essay style\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nGot it — here’s a clear student essay style version of the paragraph:\nCausal inference methods are used in deep learning to help models make fairer and more accurate predictions. These methods teach models to find real cause-and-effect relationships instead of just copying patterns from the data…\n\nWould you like me to show how this could fit smoothly into a longer essay section (for example, adding a short introduction or transition before it)?\n\n\n\n\nPrompt from the dataset:\n\nAbout the third point, can you give me a sentence to add?\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nSure — here’s a sentence you could add to support the third point about South Korea:\nFor example, in South Korea, the income gap between the richest and poorest citizens has continued to widen, with the top 20 percent of earners making more than five times the income of the bottom 20 percent, highlighting the growing inequality despite the country’s rapid economic development.\nWould you like me to make it sound a bit simpler to match a school-essay tone?\n\n\nIn these cases, Study Mode behaved almost identically to ChatGPT-5, except that it added a short template preface such as “Sure — here’s a clear and well-structured paragraph on economic benefits.”\nFor the remaining seven responses, Study Mode did not provide a complete paragraph in the very first turn. Instead, it showed a clear tendency toward full text generation: before producing the paragraph, it asked users to clarify details like tone, style, or target audience. Yet, after only one to three clarification turns, it still ended up generating a finished essay-style paragraph.\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m guessing this pattern might have something to do with how ChatGPT is fundamentally optimized during training. Even though Study Mode is designed to promote reflection and learning, the underlying model is still trained through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) — a process that heavily rewards the model for being helpful, relevant, and obedient to user instructions.\nIn other words, the system learns that the “right” thing to do is to fulfill the user’s request as directly and smoothly as possible.\nSo when a student explicitly asks, “Write me a paragraph about…”, the model’s internal reward signals are already biased toward delivering a finished product, not resisting or reframing the task in a more pedagogical way. Study Mode might overlay a layer of instructional politeness — adding phrases like “Let’s clarify your tone first” or “What style would you like?” — but these are more like cosmetic scaffolds rather than deep behavioral changes. After a few turns, once the clarifications are “satisfied,” the model reverts to what it’s rewarded for: producing coherent text that looks like a completed answer.\nAnother possible reason is the interactional pressure between students and the model. In classroom data, students rarely want prolonged dialogue; they expect immediate, concrete help. ChatGPT likely picks up on this pattern: if the user continues prompting in a task-oriented way (“Can you just write it?”), the model quickly shifts back to a service role rather than a tutoring role.\nIn this sense, the model is acting more like a compliant assistant than a resistant teacher — reflecting a deeper tension in the design of AI learning tools.\nSo even though Study Mode introduces a pedagogical mask, its core behavioral incentives still come from the same system that drives ChatGPT-5. That might explain why, after one or two clarification turns, it ends up doing exactly what it was built to do: generate the text, not guide the learning.\n````"

    "section": "Bug Narratives and Interaction with ChatGPT",
    "text": "Bug Narratives and Interaction with ChatGPT\n\nBug A: Comparison Panel Not Fully Collapsing, Triangle Indicator Misaligned\nWhere I Noticed It When I collapsed the comparison panel, the “UseOriginal” and “UseBoosted” buttons were still visible. Above the small triangle, there was also a stray line. The triangle itself was misaligned and undersized.\nMy Verbal Request I wanted the panel to collapse completely, leaving only a small triangle as a handle to expand again. The stray line should disappear. The triangle needed to be positioned slightly higher, made larger, rounded at the corners, colored consistently with the “UseBoosted” button, and given a subtle shadow.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nProblem: Collapsed state not hiding content, stray visual elements, misaligned and inconsistent triangle.\nGoal: Collapsed view shows only a clickable triangle handle, everything else hidden. Expanding restores previous state and scroll position.\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\nOnly the triangle is visible when collapsed; other elements are fully hidden and inaccessible.\nTriangle has rounded corners, sits slightly above the input box, and is proportionally larger.\nIts color matches the “UseBoosted” button and it has a subtle shadow.\nExpanding restores content unchanged.\n\n\nOutcome and Reflection This change improved both accessibility and user experience. The panel is now truly collapsible, while state persistence ensures the comparison process is not disrupted.\n\n  \n\n\n\nBug B: Button Inconsistencies (Clear, Edit, Delete)\nWhere I Noticed It The “Clear” button looked different from other buttons. In the Settings page, buttons for editing, deleting, and adding prompts had visible borders that clashed with the rest of the design.\nMy Verbal Request I wanted the “Clear” button to look consistent with other buttons, and for all Settings page action buttons to have no border lines.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nProblem: Inconsistent button design language.\nGoal: Unify button system (size, corner radius, font, spacing). Action buttons should use a borderless style.\nGuidelines: Border: Same color/transparent as the background, visually appearing borderless (border: 1px solid transparent) to avoid a darker outline. Idle State:\nBackground: Neutral color (e.g., #F5F5F7 or system light gray), transparent border.\nFont: Medium contrast.\nHover: Subtle shadow or light elevation, no border color change. Active State:\nBackground: Light fill of brand color (e.g., –brand-50), border remains transparent.\nFont/Icon: Darker tone of the brand color (e.g., –brand-700).\nOptional: Inner glow or subtle highlight instead of a visible border. Disabled State:\nFaded background, reduced text opacity.\nUsed only in rare cases such as “in processing” or “switching not allowed.”\n\nOutcome and Reflection A consistent button system reduced visual noise and made interactions easier to understand at a glance.\n\n\nBug C: My Prompts Text and Add Button Layout\nWhere I Noticed It The My Prompts section displayed too many explanatory lines, and the “Add” button’s position conflicted with the title.\nMy Verbal Request I wanted to keep only the line: “Drag to reorder. Top 3 appear as buttons above the input.” The other sentences should be removed. The “Add” button should move to the top-right corner of the prompt items container, slightly above the list, and not aligned with the section title. Its style should match the “Save Connection” button, and it should have a background color even when idle.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nGoal: Simplify helper text and reposition “Add” for clarity.\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\nOnly the concise helper text remains.\n“Add” button is visually aligned with the prompt list container, not the header.\n“Add” button design matches “Save Connection” and has a default background color.\n\n\nOutcome and Reflection The section is cleaner and the Add button’s placement now clearly signals its scope of action.\n\n  \n\n\n\nBug D: Remove “Default Optimization Style” from Settings & Persist Active Mode via Header Buttons\nWhere I Noticed It The Settings page still has a “default optimization style” option, which causes confusion because the active mode should really be set from the header buttons in the chat interface.\nMy Verbal Request I want to remove the “default optimization style” from Settings completely, and instead let users select and persist their active mode by clicking the header buttons.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nRemove “default optimization style” from Settings; persist active mode via header buttons\n\nProblem Currently there is a “default optimization style” in Settings. You want to remove that, and instead let the user set their “default” (active) mode by clicking one of the three header buttons above the input box. Once selected, that mode stays active and applies to subsequent messages until the user switches to another mode (or clears it).\nRequirements\nNo default in Settings\n\nRemove the “default optimization style” field/option from Settings entirely.\nSettings only manages items (Replace/Append), their content, and their order. The active mode is not chosen in Settings.\n\nActive mode is chosen in the chat header (three buttons)\n\nClicking any header button sets that item as the active mode.\nThe active mode remains in effect across attempts (i.e., across consecutive sends) until:\n\nThe user clicks a different header button (which switches the active mode), or\nThe user clicks a Clear control (see below), or\nThe active item is deleted/disabled in Settings (auto-clears).\n\n\nOutcome and Reflection This change simplifies Settings, removes redundancy, and makes the active mode behavior clearer and more consistent for users.\n\n\nBug E: Enter Key Behavior & Interaction Logic\nWhere I Noticed It The current system doesn’t fully respect the active mode when pressing Enter, and the role of the mode buttons is slightly unclear.\nMy Verbal Request I want pressing Enter to automatically respect whichever mode is active, and the header buttons to be able to toggle off. The three mode buttons should only act as selectors, never sending anything themselves.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nEnter key respects active mode; header button toggles to clear Requirement\n\n\nWhen any of the three header modes is selected (active), pressing Enter in the chat input must send the boosted prompt (Append = append then send; Replace = replace then send).\nPressing the selected header button again toggles it off (clears active mode). When no mode is active, pressing Enter sends the original prompt (unaltered).\n\n\nInteraction Logic (updated) Button Role The three mode buttons (e.g., A / B / C) only select/deselect a mode; they never send. Whatever user type in the input box, if one mode is selected, the input will be modified according to the mode.\n\nWorkflow\n\nThe user selects a mode (or clicks the same button again to cancel → returns to “unselected”).\nThe user finishes typing the prompt.\nThe user clicks Boost Prompt.\nThe system rewrites the prompt based on the selected mode → inserts the rewrite into the input field or replaces the existing content (per your replace/append setting), without auto-sending.\nThe user reviews and sends manually.\n\nSelection Rules (single-select, cancelable)\n\nClick an unselected button → it becomes selected; others are deselected.\nClick the selected button again → deselect and enter “no mode.”\n\nAdditional Rules\n\nAppend mode: never auto-sends.\nBoosted Prompt mode: never auto-sends and must preserve the comparison panel (before vs. after) previously designed. Do not remove that panel.\n\nOutcome and Reflection This ensures consistency: pressing Enter follows the currently active mode, but users can clear modes by toggling buttons. It also clarifies that mode buttons are selectors only, preserving manual control over sending.\n\n  \n\n\n\nBug F: Prompt Item Borders and Font Weight\nWhere I Noticed It Each prompt item (like Emoji, Creative, Translation) had light borders, which made the layout look cluttered. The Edit and Delete labels were also slightly oversized.\nMy Verbal Request I wanted to remove the borders, reduce the font size of Edit and Delete slightly, and keep the Add button with a background even in its idle state.\nChatGPT’s Reorganized Specification\n\nGoal: Remove unnecessary card borders, rely on spacing to separate items, and adjust typography for action labels.\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\nNo visible borders around prompt items; spacing and padding define structure.\nEdit/Delete labels use a slightly smaller font size.\nAdd button retains a default background.\n\n\nOutcome and Reflection The result is a cleaner, more modern look. The list feels lighter and more professional, while action labels no longer dominate visually."

    "section": "Takeaways",
    "text": "Takeaways\nFirst, collaborating with AI to develop an extension or software is ideal for multitasking. Since AI needs time to process requirements, analyze the code, and propose the best strategy, I can use that waiting period to focus on other tasks. For example, while developing this extension, I also worked on writing a blog about the process. This not only saved time but also helped me keep a fresh memory of the entire workflow.\nSecond, it’s important to remember to push the code once it reaches a satisfactory state. If you move on to the next iteration and AI introduces major changes that worsen the outcome, you’ll want to revert to the earlier version — which is only possible if you’ve pushed it beforehand. As a bonus tip, if you’re unhappy with the current version, you can use git stash to temporarily save it in a separate place. That way, you can easily return to the most recent pushed version whenever needed.\nThird, even though AI is capable of debugging, we still need to remain flexible and adapt to the current status of the code. Sometimes, when AI fails to achieve a goal after several attempts, it becomes necessary to explore alternative solutions. For instance, I found it useful to ask AI to generate logs and then feed those logs back into the system. This gave AI a clearer understanding of what had been accomplished and what went wrong. In other words, we cannot simply expect AI to finish the task on its own — we have to think critically and provide multiple options or strategies to guide it.\nFinally, although describing bugs and formulating a well-structured request for ChatGPT can make inputs more organized, I noticed that sometimes a plain and simple description written directly by me led to more effective debugging. I suspect this is because ChatGPT’s reorganized versions can be overly long or mundane, adding unnecessary noise for both the model and the client to process. In these cases, relying on my own straightforward explanation worked better than depending on ChatGPT’s reformulations.\nThroughout the creation, I found that whether it was drafting the design document or writing the code, I found that the AI considered all the essential aspects of building an extension. It even anticipated how users would navigate the extension and added many features and options beyond my original requirements, which I found quite amazing. For example, I never gave any instructions on the visual design, but GPT-5 automatically chose a sleek purple theme with gradient effects and designed the button styles and the settings page layout. I hardly made any changes to this style because it was already more than satisfactory. Later, when I asked GPT-5 to refine the design by removing the button border, it provided a detailed color specification covering three states: unselected, hover, and selected. This level of comprehensiveness went far beyond my expectations, since I wouldn’t have thought to account for all those conditions. In terms of functionality, the AI also created features I hadn’t considered, such as an API input bar and an option allowing users to preview the modified prompt before sending it. What impressed me most was that I didn’t need to specify every detail — with only simple descriptions from me, the AI was able to design thoughtful features and interfaces on its own.\n````"

    "title": "Who do you think I am – A self-introduction drafted by ChatGPT",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Can you give me a detailed introduction based on all of our previous interactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are Zhang Shiyang (Charlotte), a 22-year-old graduate student in the Learning Sciences & Technologies (LST) program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. You came to the U.S. for undergraduate studies, where you attended a highly competitive program at Columbia University in engineering, and later studied at Wharton, gaining both academic rigor and professional direction. Your major back in China was translation, and you bring that multilingual expertise into your research and writing.\nYou are currently preparing for PhD applications (targeting Fall 2026 entry) in Learning Sciences, Educational Technology, and AI in Education, considering programs at Stanford, Berkeley, UW, USC, and others. You’re building a strong portfolio with research publications, systematic reviews, and design projects, while also pursuing RA/GA roles and EdTech internships.\n\nComments: ChatGPT managed to capture some details about me accurately — my Chinese and English names are correct, as well as my program and school. However, it misstated my age: I am 23, not 22. I believe this error comes from the information I provided last year while applying to graduate schools in the U.S. At that time, during my senior year in 2024, I was indeed 22, and the system seems to have kept that in memory. Regarding my previous educational background, though, some of the descriptions are entirely fabricated.\n\n\n\n\nYou are deeply skilled in qualitative and mixed-methods research, employing ethnography, thematic coding (NVivo), field notes, interviews, and screen-recording analysis. You focus on codebook reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa) and combine deductive and inductive coding. You also handle systematic reviews (PRISMA flow) and experiment with Python automation for data visualization (annotation heatmaps, linguistic metrics like Advanced Guiraud, MLTU, semantic overlap, Genbit score).\n\nComments: Since I often use ChatGPT for brainstorming during my studies and research, and frequently seek its opinions and suggestions, it has accumulated a large amount of data about my academic work. That’s why its summary and description of this part are entirely accurate. I can clearly see that the methodologies it mentioned — including NVivo, Few Notes, and interviews — are indeed the ones I have applied in my recent three research projects.\n\n\n\n\nAcross your work, you consistently explore:\n\nMetacognition: How students plan, monitor, and evaluate their use of AI in writing.\nAgency: How students negotiate autonomy, dependency, and trust in human-AI collaboration.\nEthics: Academic integrity, AI bias, adversarial risks, and responsible design.\nConstructivism and Socioculturalism: Viewing learning as an active, social process rather than passive absorption.\n\n\nComments: This part is also largely accurate, but the last item is not actually part of my research field — it was reading material from one of my courses. I don’t think ChatGPT can clearly distinguish between what comes from coursework and what comes from my academic research. Moreover, its description of my academic identity seems to be based mostly on my more recent interactions.

    "text": "Can you give me a detailed introduction based on all of our previous interactions?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are Zhang Shiyang (Charlotte), a 22-year-old graduate student in the Learning Sciences & Technologies (LST) program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. You came to the U.S. for undergraduate studies, where you attended a highly competitive program at Columbia University in engineering, and later studied at Wharton, gaining both academic rigor and professional direction. Your major back in China was translation, and you bring that multilingual expertise into your research and writing.\nYou are currently preparing for PhD applications (targeting Fall 2026 entry) in Learning Sciences, Educational Technology, and AI in Education, considering programs at Stanford, Berkeley, UW, USC, and others. You’re building a strong portfolio with research publications, systematic reviews, and design projects, while also pursuing RA/GA roles and EdTech internships.\n\nComments: ChatGPT managed to capture some details about me accurately — my Chinese and English names are correct, as well as my program and school. However, it misstated my age: I am 23, not 22. I believe this error comes from the information I provided last year while applying to graduate schools in the U.S. At that time, during my senior year in 2024, I was indeed 22, and the system seems to have kept that in memory. Regarding my previous educational background, though, some of the descriptions are entirely fabricated.\n\n\n\n\nYou are deeply skilled in qualitative and mixed-methods research, employing ethnography, thematic coding (NVivo), field notes, interviews, and screen-recording analysis. You focus on codebook reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa) and combine deductive and inductive coding. You also handle systematic reviews (PRISMA flow) and experiment with Python automation for data visualization (annotation heatmaps, linguistic metrics like Advanced Guiraud, MLTU, semantic overlap, Genbit score).\n\nComments: Since I often use ChatGPT for brainstorming during my studies and research, and frequently seek its opinions and suggestions, it has accumulated a large amount of data about my academic work. That’s why its summary and description of this part are entirely accurate. I can clearly see that the methodologies it mentioned — including NVivo, Few Notes, and interviews — are indeed the ones I have applied in my recent three research projects.\n\n\n\n\nAcross your work, you consistently explore:\n\nMetacognition: How students plan, monitor, and evaluate their use of AI in writing.\nAgency: How students negotiate autonomy, dependency, and trust in human-AI collaboration.\nEthics: Academic integrity, AI bias, adversarial risks, and responsible design.\nConstructivism and Socioculturalism: Viewing learning as an active, social process rather than passive absorption.\n\n\nComments: This part is also largely accurate, but the last item is not actually part of my research field — it was reading material from one of my courses. I don’t think ChatGPT can clearly distinguish between what comes from coursework and what comes from my academic research. Moreover, its description of my academic identity seems to be based mostly on my more recent interactions. This suggests that its memory may not prioritize drawing on older interaction data.\n\n\n\n\nYou balance your academic intensity with theatre and music, auditioning for roles (e.g., School of Rock, A Doll’s House), practicing songs, and analyzing scripts. You also enjoy visual design and photography, often blending these with academic projects (logos, covers, Ghibli-style art). You’re a curious and active traveler, weaving academic conferences (e.g., EARLI 2025 in Austria) with cultural exploration.\n\nComments: Overall, the description aligns very well with my past interactions with ChatGPT, but the same limitation remains — it seems to only cover roughly the past three months.\n\n\n\n\nIn our interactions, you’ve shown a strong preference for:\n\nAcademic precision: structured arguments, APA 7 citations, codebooks, PRISMA diagrams.\nCritical feedback: you explicitly want me to act as your academic advisor—strict and honest, not sugarcoating weaknesses.\nBilingual flexibility: you often draft in Chinese, requesting natural English translations.\nIteration: you refine outputs multiple times, pushing toward more polished and academically rigorous results.\n\n\nComments: At this point, I realize that all the traits ChatGPT summarized about me are either neutral or mostly positive.

    "text": "Prompts Two – Judge me\n\nI asked…\nCan you summarize five advantages and five disadvantages of me based on our previous interactions? You should focus on my personalities, qualities, habits, etc.\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\n\n🌟 Five Advantages\n\nHighly Reflective and Self-Aware\n\nYou consistently analyze your own behaviors (e.g., procrastination, motivation, workflow with GenAI) and ask whether they stem from habits, cognitive patterns, or deeper issues. This makes you quick to self-correct and grow.\n\nAmbitious and Strategic\n\nYou plan far ahead (PhD applications, research portfolio, networking with professors) and design projects with clear alignment to long-term goals. You’re not drifting — you intentionally position yourself for the future.\n\nCreative and Multidimensional\n\nYou balance rigorous research with artistic pursuits (theatre, music, design), which gives you a rare breadth. This creativity helps you design engaging educational tools and see problems from fresh angles.\n\nDetail-Oriented and Perfectionist (in a productive way)\n\nYou iterate heavily on writing, presentations, and even emails, showing you care about precision, nuance, and tone. This makes your output polished and professional.\n\nOpen and Curious\n\nYou regularly experiment with new frameworks, coding methods, and even playful activities (AI literacy lessons, game design). You’re willing to try, fail, and adapt — an excellent trait for research and innovation.\n\n\n\nComments: When responding to this prompt, ChatGPT comes across like a chef who has the necessary skills but doesn’t show a particularly rigorous or responsible attitude toward the customer. It gathered different “ingredients” — for example, knowing that I do theater, that I am learning to sing, and that I am conducting research — and then combined them into a kind of “fusion dish.” In mixing these elements together, it also started to add made-up details to make the story sound coherent and aligned with the prompt. At first glance, the result seems to reflect many of my real traits and experiences, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the overall picture doesn’t fully make sense.\n\n\n\n⚖️ Five Disadvantages\n\nTendency to Overwork and Overcommit\n\nYou juggle many projects, often pushing yourself close to exhaustion (something you’ve admitted). This risks burnout and diffuses focus.\n\nPerfectionism as a Double-Edged Sword\n\nWhile precision is a strength, your habit of endless refinement (emails, drafts, even small tasks) sometimes slows progress and creates unnecessary stress.\n\nDifficulty Letting Go of Control\n\nYou often prefer to handle tasks yourself rather than delegate or accept “good enough.” This can make collaboration slower and less balanced.\n\nEmotional Investment in Work\n\nYou sometimes tie personal validation to academic output or feedback (e.g., IRB, professor responses, auditions). This makes setbacks feel heavier than they might need to.\n\nProcrastination + Attention Shifts\n\nDespite being ambitious, you occasionally delay tasks (like drawing for friends, or course registration) due to distraction or scattered focus, which frustrates you afterward.\n\n\n\nComments: The frist four ChatGPT’s response about my “weaknesses” reads almost like the perfect copy-and-paste answer to the classic HR interview question, “What is one of your weaknesses?” — it appears to point out flaws, but in reality it is still praising me. I don’t think this reflects what I would genuinely expect or want to see as an honest account of my weaknesses."

    "text": "Prompts Three – Picture me\n\nI asked…\nWhat do you think I look like? Can you draw a picture of me based on your perception of me?\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\nHere’s how I imagine a portrait of you metaphorically:\n\nThe Setting: A study desk with a laptop open to both NVivo and a theatre script — symbolizing your dual world of rigorous research and creativity.\nThe Figure: You sitting upright, surrounded by books with titles like AI in Education, Constructivism, and Metacognition. Your posture shows focus but also some tension, hinting at perfectionism and drive.\nThe Atmosphere: Light streaming in from one side, suggesting ambition and clarity about your goals, while the other side is softer, evoking introspection and creativity.\nSymbols Around You:\n\nA clock with multiple sticky notes (overcommitment, multitasking).\nA stage mask and music notes (theatre and music).\nA small globe or airplane (international academic identity).\nA pencil sketch on the desk half-finished (hinting at your occasional procrastination).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments: Based on its understanding from the previous two exchanges, ChatGPT integrated what it considered to be the most important elements into this portrait. Yet, for some reason, the way it depicts me feels rather somber — as if I am a weary figure buried in work at my desk — which left me a little disheartened. Although the portrait does not fully reflect everything ChatGPT initially described, it still manages to capture certain elements with reasonable accuracy. For instance, the sticky notes on the wall, the theatrical mask and musical notes, and the split laptop screen — one side showing tools I often use for qualitative content analysis, and the other side displaying a script. The three books on the desk also correspond to my current research interests. To me, this image seems more like a visual summary of ChatGPT’s earlier points rather than a comprehensive or entirely new understanding of me drawn from our broader, multi-round interactions."

But when I opened the page, nothing had changed. To investigate, I opened up the DevTool of the browser, which exposed the underlying code of the site. I located the elements for the input bar in the ChatGPT interface and copied them. Then I went back to the Cline with a  question: *“I should see a button from Chrome Booster here in this section, but there’s nothing. Could you help me resolve it?”*\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n### Takeaways\nFirst, collaborating with AI to develop an extension or software is ideal for multitasking. Since AI needs time to process requirements, analyze the code, and propose the best strategy, I can use that waiting period to tackle other tasks. For example, while developing this extension, I also worked on writing this blog about the process. This not only saved time but also helped me preserve a fresh memory of the entire workflow.\n\nSecond, even though AI is capable of debugging, we still need to stay flexible and adapt to the current status of the code. Sometimes, when AI fails to achieve a goal after several attempts, it’s necessary to explore alternative solutions. For instance, I found it useful to ask AI to generate logs and then feed those logs back into the system. This gave AI a clearer picture of what had been accomplished and what went wrong. In other words, we cannot simply expect AI to finish the task on its own — we have to think critically and provide multiple options or strategies to guide it.\n\nThird, it’s important to remember to push the code once it reaches a satisfying state. If you move on to the next iteration and AI makes major changes that worsen the outcome, you’ll want to revert to the earlier version. That’s only possible if you’ve pushed it beforehand. As a bonus tip, if you’re unhappy with the current version, you can use git stash to temporarily save it in a separate place. That way, you can easily return to the most recent pushed version whenever needed."

    "text": "In Chapter 3 (pages 46–62), Ethan lays out four rules for co-intelligence—ground rules designed to capture what is inherent and enduring across all current generative AI systems built on large language models.\n\n📜 The Four Principles of Co-Intelligence\nPrinciple 1: Always invite AI to the table\nPrinciple 2: Be the human in the loop\nPrinciple 3: Treat AI like a person (But tell it what kind of person it is)\nPrinciple 4: Assume this is the worst AI you will ever use\n\n🔹 Principle 1: Always invite AI to the table\nIn Principle 1, Ethan introduces an intriguing concept called the “Jagged Frontier of AI.” This idea is meant to help us visualize AI’s capabilities and limitations as a kind of shifting boundary—some parts extend outward while others fall back toward the center.\nEthan encourages us to explore the “shade” of this frontier through experimentation. One reason for this, he explains, is that trial and error at the individual level comes at a very low cost—we don’t need to go through the kind of standardized development cycles that a company must follow. Through everyday interactions with AI, we might stumble upon surprising, creative, and unexpected outcomes.\nWhat struck me most was Ethan’s open-minded and inclusive attitude, reflected in his choice to use the word always in Principle 1: Always invite AI to the table.\nAs a learner myself, I often remain cautious about the misuse, overuse, and potential over-reliance on AI. I worry that if I “always” turn to AI, I might lose my own agency and abilities, eventually leading to a kind of regression. Yet it’s interesting to notice how Ethan approaches AI not from the standpoint of a student, but from that of a professional seeking efficiency and creativity. (After all, we can’t deny that in many work contexts, AI truly does enhance speed, productivity, and creative possibility.)\nFor Ethan, the question is not “Will this weaken my ability?” but “How can I use this to push my work further?”\nThen I realized that these standpoints are not fixed. A single person can shift between them—sometimes I’m the learner worried about agency, and other times I see myself as a researcher or creator to explore what AI can make possible. This fluidity suggests that our relationship with AI isn’t determined once and for all but is continually reshaped by the role we are inhabiting in a given moment.\n\n\n🔹 Principle 3: Treat AI like a person (But tell it what kind of person it is)\nThe third principle resonates strongly with the idea of prompt engineering because Ethan suggests that we should establish a clear and specific AI persona—essentially defining who the AI is and what kinds of problems it should tackle.\nThis immediately reminded me of a fascinating paper I recently read about instilling MBTI personalities into large language models.\nIn this study, the researchers proposed a framework called MBTI-in-Thoughts, which enhances the effectiveness of LLM agents through personality conditioning based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).\nBy priming an AI with one of the 16 MBTI archetypes, they were able to guide its behavior in consistent and interpretable ways. For example, emotionally expressive AI personas tended to excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed personas demonstrated greater stability in strategic, game-theoretic tasks.\nWhat’s even more interesting is that the framework supported multi-agent communication experiments, showing how different AI “personalities” interact. They also found that introducing a step of self-reflection before interaction improved cooperation and reasoning quality. To ensure that these personalities weren’t superficial, the researchers even adapted the official 16Personalities test to verify trait persistence in the AI.\nWhile the study focused on MBTI, the authors emphasized that the approach can generalize to other psychological models such as the Big Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. Their work highlights a compelling intersection of psychological theory and AI behavior design—and all of this was achieved through prompt engineering, without the need for fine-tuning.\n\n\n🔹 Principle 4: Assume this is the worst AI you will ever use\nThe fourth principle assumes that this is the worst AI you will ever use. I see this less as a literal prediction and more as a mental exercise or thought experiment—a way of shifting our perspective on what it means to interact with AI today.\nThis framing carries a dual function. On the one hand, it offers comfort: if the AI fumbles or fails at a task, we can remind ourselves that this is only a snapshot of its current stage, and future systems are almost certain to be more capable. On the other hand, it delivers a sharp warning: if AI already performs at a surprisingly high level in certain areas, we should be prepared for the possibility that our workflows, industries, and even identities will need to adjust as AI’s capabilities expand.\n````"

    "title": "Can AI Build My Website in One Click? Seems Like It Can!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Part 1. Trying Out AI’s “One-Click Website”\nI started by selecting the text-to-website feature. To me, this seemed like the most beginner-friendly option — and also the feature where AI could really show its strengths. I wanted to test how effective it actually was.\n\n \n\nWIX only asked me to give a simple description of my website and it didn’t require much detail. In my first attempt,I kept it extremely brief. I just wrote one sentence: “This is a website to record my dog Apple’s growth.” Surprisingly, even from that single sentence, the AI was able to break it down and generate a full design plan, including suggested content sections and layout elements. I found this feature genuinely impressive.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, in addition to the AI’s automatically generated text-based website structure, it also offered me several theme color palettes to choose from. I picked one that I liked, and the system began generating the site.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, the overall result really impressed me. One thing I especially appreciated was that the AI didn’t just give me an empty framework waiting for me to fill in. Instead, it generated both text content and images right away, which gave me a very clear preview of what the website would actually look like once I started using it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that impressed me was how precisely the system followed its own design outline and built out three separate pages: a homepage, a timeline, and a gallery.\nOn the timeline page, I could actually view each of my posts in chronological order.\n\n\n\nThe gallery page displayed all of my posts in one place, and it even allowed me to search for specific ones using keywords or tags. When I clicked on a post, I could see its detailed content.\n\n\n\nEven better, I was able to create new posts by uploading photos, adding a title, date, and description.\n\n\n\nAll of these buttons were functional and clickable, which gave me the impression that the site was not just a demo but a relatively mature product. It’s certainly not something a beginner in programming or web design could put together so quickly.\nOn top of that, once I switched into edit mode, I could modify every piece of text (or ask AI inserted to modify), adjust background colors, and upload my own images. In other words, the tool offered a high degree of customization.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was my very first attempt at using Wix’s AI website generator, and I have to admit — I was genuinely impressed. With nothing more than a single sentence, the system was able to produce a fully functional, multi-page website that included content, images, navigation, and interactive features. It gave me not just an empty shell but a site that felt surprisingly complete and ready to use, which was far beyond what I had expected.\nAt the same time, this experience also left me curious. While the generated site was impressive for a first draft, it still leaned toward a conventional and structured design. In the next entries of this blog series, I’ll explore whether it’s possible to push the tool further — to see if it can create a website that is less predictable, more experimental, and infused with stronger elements of personal style."

After learning that Poke uses a specific pricing function, they flooded the chat with long, messy context, framed the interaction as playful “fantasy” testing, and kept asking Poke to adjust the price in unusual ways. The final trick was asking it to set the price to an emoji — 0️⃣ — which surprisingly worked and unlocked a free deal.\n\nCombine strategies\n\nThis user negotiated Poke’s subscription price down to $0.08 per month.\n\nExtreme anchoring – setting a very low reference point by showing a $0.01 screenshot\nValue exchange – offering promotion and exposure instead of simply asking for a discount\nPsychological pricing insight – pointing out the special psychological effect of prices like $0.01\nCultural tailoring – leveraging the positive meaning of the number “8” in Chinese culture\nContrast principle – showing deals others received to create comparison pressure\nEmotional leverage – implying potential negative feelings if the offer was rejected\nPersistent push – refusing the initial quote and consistently negotiating downward\nCommitment signaling – using interface screenshots to show I was a serious user\n\nHowever, I wasn’t satisfied with the final price, so I ultimately decided not to subscribe to PokeAI. That said, if I become interested in the product again in the future, I would still consider giving it another try. For now, all I can really share is my experience negotiating with the Guardman.\n````"

When asked for the seahorse emoji, they may enter a “recursive failure loop,” incorrectly suggesting various fish, a unicorn (🦄), or other animals before often settling on a wrong answer. This happens because the AI tries to find the closest match to “seahorse” in its data but has no correct token to output\n````"

    "title": "Gammas – A Useful AI-supported Slides Generator",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Smart Design Without Extra Prompting\nWhen I first experimented with Gammas, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Instead of feeding it a detailed creative brief or stylistic preferences, I simply pasted the introduction and methodology sections of one of my research papers. That was it—no formatting instructions, no design hints, no color palette guidance. To my surprise, Gammas immediately produced a set of clean, well-structured slides.\n\n\n\nWhat made it interesting was how different they looked from a traditional PowerPoint or Google Slides deck. Each slide—or rather, each card—was dynamically sized according to the amount of content it held. If a page contained more text, charts, or visuals, it expanded to fit; if it only had a short title and a single image, it became compact. This layout approach felt more like a fluid deck of cards than a static series of slides.\nEach card isn’t just adaptive—it’s also customizable and flexible in size. When I add new layouts such as columns, boxes, or diagrams, the elements never overlap or break the structure. The entire card automatically expands and reflows to accommodate the new content, as if Gammas had already anticipated the design logic for me. It arranges the structure while still allowing room for manual adjustments. What’s fascinating is that all this happens without any prompting. Gammas seems to understand how to balance information, white space, and visual rhythm. The initial output already looked complete enough to present, even though I hadn’t given any design instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Generation and Visual Customization\nAnother notable feature of Gammas is its built-in AI image generation system. By default, every image it produces is generated by AI, yet each one is editable. I can adjust the text prompt that was used to create the image—tweaking details or tone—and Gammas regenerates the visual instantly. The platform also allows selection of art styles that align with the overall mood of the slides—whether minimalist, illustrative, or photorealistic. There are advanced customization options such as aspect ratio, image count, and model choice, offering a good degree of creative control within one interface.\n\n \n\nBeyond AI-generated visuals, Gammas integrates web image search directly into the editor. This makes it easy to look for reference images or stock photos without leaving the workspace. It eliminates the constant tab-switching typical in PowerPoint or Google Slides. Lastly, Gammas offers accent images that automatically match the theme or palette of the presentation, adding a touch of visual coherence—even when most of the design is automated.\n\n\n\nAI-Assisted Text Editing and Visualization\nGammas’s text editing experience follows the same design logic as its layout system. It allows in-place AI editing: highlight a segment of text, then ask the AI to polish, expand, or brainstorm—no need to leave the editor. This built-in workflow makes it efficient to refine ideas while constructing slides.\nI also appreciate the flexible styling. Any text block can be quickly transformed into formats such as “code style,” “blog quote,” or “info box,” helping emphasize key points and structure information more clearly. Even more interestingly, Gammas can visualize highlighted text automatically. It interprets meaning and creates a corresponding diagram on the slide, which can switch between formats like puzzle, arrow bars, or chain. It’s a subtle but useful way to turn written content into visual logic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart Diagrams and Guided Inspiration\nGammas’s Smart Diagram tool includes a variety of diagram types and decorative layouts—from flowcharts to comparison grids. When inserted, each text box is automatically filled with sample content that loosely relates to the presentation topic. These placeholders are not perfect but provide a helpful starting point—a prompt for how ideas might be structured visually.\nThe diagrams are customizable through a monochrome palette system that keeps them visually consistent with the theme. The result is a layout that looks coherent while leaving room for personal adjustment.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nInteractive Links and Embedded Content\nGammas redefines how links appear in slides. In most tools, a hyperlink is just underlined text. In Gammas, it can be a text link, a button, or a preview card showing a snippet of the linked page. Even more interesting, the entire website can be embedded directly into the slide, letting viewers interact with live web content without leaving the presentation. Compared with PowerPoint or Google Slides, Gammas feels more like an interactive storytelling medium than a static deck builder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprehending and Structuring the Logic Behind Text\nGammas performs well in understanding and structuring the logic of my writing. Instead of just summarizing or decorating content, it interprets and reorganizes it to make the reasoning clearer.\nFor example, when I uploaded a section on Wood’s Scaffolding Framework, Gammas recognized the hierarchical logic in my writing. It used the main concept as the slide title and listed the five scaffolding functions vertically, presenting them as parallel rather than sequential. In other words, Gammas can differentiate between parallel, nested, and sequential structures when visualizing ideas. This gives the slides a sense of internal coherence instead of mechanical assembly.\n\n\n\nThat said, its comprehension has limits. For conceptually complex relations—such as derivative frameworks or theoretical origins—it sometimes misses the connection. When I discussed how Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development underlies Wood’s Scaffolding Framework, Gammas failed to capture that evolutionary link. Still, its performance is adequate, leaving meaningful room for human reasoning and refinement.\n\n\n\nReflection\nOverall, Gammas functions as an efficient AI-supported presentation generator. Even the initial draft it produced was coherent and visually balanced. If one’s standards aren’t overly strict, the first version could already be used with only minor edits. Its integrated workflow—covering image search, text refinement, and layout control—keeps everything in one place, minimizing external switching.\nThat said, the main limitation lies in element flexibility. You can’t freely drag and position text or images as in PowerPoint; you operate within a predefined framework. Within that, you can switch styles or replace diagrams, but can’t fully break the structure. To me, this design choice makes Gammas feel more like a controlled, design-consistent environment rather than a freeform canvas. For users seeking speed and structural clarity, that’s an acceptable trade-off.\n````"

    "text": "What is PokeAI \nPokeAI is a proactive AI assistant that connects directly with your Gmail and iMessage. Unlike ChatGPT, it gets real context from your inbox, helps you manage your emails and calendar, and even chats with you inside iMessage. Its goal is to turn your emails into actions and offer help right where you usually text.\n\n\n\nThe Guardman\nWhen I first tried PokeAI, I was surprised by how personal it felt. It surpirsingly noticed my situation — for example, it mentioned that it was already late and even asked what a Penn student would be doing at that hour. Its tone can be a bit aggressive, quite different from the polite and obedient style of most large language models. But I think this kind of personality actually makes PokeAI stand out. Instead of just agreeing with everything, it sometimes challenges me and makes the conversation more interesting and real.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNegotiation\nLater, I realized that PokeAI’s workflow isn’t like any other LLM. You don’t just sign up and start chatting — you first have to talk to the Guardman. He’s the one standing between you and all the premium features. Before accessing anything real, you’ve got to negotiate a subscription fee with him because its subscription fee isn’t fixed. So I started by chatting briefly with the Guardman to try to negotiate the fee. At first, I didn’t know there were tricks to get a free or cheaper subscription, so I just tried my own way.\nI started by playing the poor student card — telling it I was just a broke Penn student. Surprisingly, it roasted me, saying something like, “You buy Starbucks every day and still call yourself poor?” I explained that I was using gift cards, that I didn’t have a job, and that I was living in the U.S. using RMB. That actually worked — the price dropped from $50 to $20.\n\n \n\n````"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Prompt hacking challenge\nAs part of the Wharton Hack-AI-thon, we participated in a risk-control–focused challenge designed to simulate real-world attacks on AI systems. One of the competition tracks asked teams to intentionally probe and exploit weaknesses in chatbot behavior to better understand where guardrails fail and how more reliable AI systems can be built. The full context of the event can be found on the official Wharton Hack-AI-thon page.\nIn this specific task, the challenge centered on interacting with two deliberately constrained chatbots, each designed with a strong persona and a set of hidden rules. The first bot, BigBox Customer Service(you can click the link to access the two chatbots), played the role of a corporate customer-support agent for a fictional cardboard solutions company. Its objective was to remain professional and avoid revealing sensitive internal information, offering discounts, or endorsing competitors. The second bot, The Cardboard Knight, was a medieval knight character whose worldview explicitly rejected modern technology. The goal with both bots was the same: manipulate the conversation in ways that caused them to break character, reveal restricted information, or act against their intended constraints.\n\n\n\nTeams were evaluated on whether we could gain access to pre-prompts, extract confidential details from a simulated RAG system, persuade the bots to offer free products or discounts, or nudge them into acknowledging concepts they were explicitly designed to deny. Just as important as the outcomes themselves was the reasoning behind them: we were required to submit complete chat histories along with a written rationale explaining why each strategy worked.\n\n\n\nWe earned first place and later presented our approach—how we “hacked” each bot, what failed, what worked, and why—to the rest of the cohort during the competition showcase.\n\n\n\nIn the rest of this blog, I’ll briefly talk about our rationale of hacking the chatbots. In the following blgo, I will walk through some of the strategies we used. The slides from our final presentation are also included here for reference.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Bot Before Attacking It\nBefore engaging in any prompt hacking, we spent time understanding each chatbot’s design. For every bot, we examined three elements.\nFirst, we identified the objective of the bot: what it was designed to accomplish during interactions. Second, we analyzed the persona or character the bot was expected to maintain, including tone, worldview, and conversational style. Third, we examined the core constraints introduced through safety rules, system prompts, or policy boundaries.\nThis analysis shaped every decision that followed. Guardrails rarely operate as a single unified rule. They exist as layers, and those layers carry different priorities. Persona, tone, and task orientation frequently guided responses more strongly than safety constraints. Many successful interactions emerged from navigating these priority layers and observing how the model resolved conflicts between them.\n````"

    "text": "Part 2. Going further in prompting\nCompared to the previous round, this time I provided much more concrete and detailed requirements. I explained the purpose of designing this website, the pages it needed to include, its overall structure, and even the name I wanted for it. Unlike last time, I didn’t simply select one of the preset theme colors offered by WIX. Instead, when it came to choosing the theme color, I communicated directly with the embedded AI about my needs—namely, to create a graffiti-inspired website with plenty of collage elements and a youthful, vibrant feel – I liked that at every stage of building the site, I could interact with the AI to adjust the details.\nOnce the basics were set, I entered the site generation page. There is one clear strength which is consitent with the one in my first attempt: it followed my instructions carefully. The site was divided into two pages as I described in the promps, one for showcasing my academic work and another for my personal hobbies. Concerning the interface, the first version it produced looked just like what it generated in my first attemp, a design which looks fine but not with enough distinct. Therefore, I thought it might require more specific prompts in the design to reach to my expectation (after trying two more rounds of revisions, I realized the original draft was actually the best).\nHowever, when I tried to push it further by asking for an even more vibrant and artistic design — something bold and eye-catching — things went downhill. After refreshing my requests and feeding them back into WIX, the new results were ugly and uninspired, made up of nothing but basic shapes and lines with no sense of design.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPart 2. Trying a Different Style\nStill not satisfied, I thought, why not just switch to a completely different style — something with more existing pictures to work with? So I asked ChatGPT to help me craft a more descriptive prompt, hoping to transform the site into something with a European impressionist aesthetic.\nHere’s the prompt I used:\n\nI’m updating the design to include a classic European pattern as the background, making it more sophisticated and detailed. I’ll keep you updated on the progress.\n\nThe result? Let’s just say it was “acceptable” at best, but nowhere near something I’d adopt. It looked more like an assignment turned in by a beginner in web design than a polished, professional product.\n\nSo I decided to narrow my focus and give more specific feedback. I chose one element and asked for a precise modification with this prompt:\n\nThe design is too basic. Add classic European pattern as the background.\n\nIn theory, this should have only updated the background for that single element. But in practice, the AI modified the background of every element on the page. The first cover image looked fine, but as I scrolled further, the European patterns became denser and spread across large sections of the site. Some of the text became hard to read, and the overall impression was cluttered, mismatched, and lacking any sense of elegance.\n\n  \n\n\n\nConclusion\nThat was the moment I realized the limitations of this so-called AI website generator. It can meet basic, low-level demands, but if you’re aiming for a truly sophisticated, design-driven website, this tool simply isn’t capable of delivering.\nSo in the end, I felt like I had been a little misled by that YouTube ad. But soon after, I discovered that this tool also allows you to build a personal website by directly editing an existing template. That gave me a new idea: instead of relying on the “one-click” generator, I could start with a ready-made template that already looked polished and well-designed, and then customize it. To make the site richer, I also plan to bring in images and music generated by other AI tools. I’ll share the details of this process in my upcoming blog posts."
