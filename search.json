    "text": "Prompts Two – Judge me\n\nI asked…\nCan you summarize five advantages and five disadvantages of me based on our previous interactions? You should focus on my personalities, qualities, habits, etc.\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\n\n🌟 Five Advantages\n\nHighly Reflective and Self-Aware\n\nYou consistently analyze your own behaviors (e.g., procrastination, motivation, workflow with GenAI) and ask whether they stem from habits, cognitive patterns, or deeper issues. This makes you quick to self-correct and grow.\n\nAmbitious and Strategic\n\nYou plan far ahead (PhD applications, research portfolio, networking with professors) and design projects with clear alignment to long-term goals. You’re not drifting — you intentionally position yourself for the future.\n\nCreative and Multidimensional\n\nYou balance rigorous research with artistic pursuits (theatre, music, design), which gives you a rare breadth. This creativity helps you design engaging educational tools and see problems from fresh angles.\n\nDetail-Oriented and Perfectionist (in a productive way)\n\nYou iterate heavily on writing, presentations, and even emails, showing you care about precision, nuance, and tone. This makes your output polished and professional.\n\nOpen and Curious\n\nYou regularly experiment with new frameworks, coding methods, and even playful activities (AI literacy lessons, game design). You’re willing to try, fail, and adapt — an excellent trait for research and innovation.\n\n\n\nComments: When responding to this prompt, ChatGPT comes across like a chef who has the necessary skills but doesn’t show a particularly rigorous or responsible attitude toward the customer. It gathered different “ingredients” — for example, knowing that I do theater, that I am learning to sing, and that I am conducting research — and then combined them into a kind of “fusion dish.” In mixing these elements together, it also started to add made-up details to make the story sound coherent and aligned with the prompt. At first glance, the result seems to reflect many of my real traits and experiences, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the overall picture doesn’t fully make sense.\n\n\n\n⚖️ Five Disadvantages\n\nTendency to Overwork and Overcommit\n\nYou juggle many projects, often pushing yourself close to exhaustion (something you’ve admitted). This risks burnout and diffuses focus.\n\nPerfectionism as a Double-Edged Sword\n\nWhile precision is a strength, your habit of endless refinement (emails, drafts, even small tasks) sometimes slows progress and creates unnecessary stress.\n\nDifficulty Letting Go of Control\n\nYou often prefer to handle tasks yourself rather than delegate or accept “good enough.” This can make collaboration slower and less balanced.\n\nEmotional Investment in Work\n\nYou sometimes tie personal validation to academic output or feedback (e.g., IRB, professor responses, auditions). This makes setbacks feel heavier than they might need to.\n\nProcrastination + Attention Shifts\n\nDespite being ambitious, you occasionally delay tasks (like drawing for friends, or course registration) due to distraction or scattered focus, which frustrates you afterward.\n\n\n\nComments: The frist four ChatGPT’s response about my “weaknesses” reads almost like the perfect copy-and-paste answer to the classic HR interview question, “What is one of your weaknesses?” — it appears to point out flaws, but in reality it is still praising me. I don’t think this reflects what I would genuinely expect or want to see as an honest account of my weaknesses."

    "text": "Prompts Three – Picture me\n\nI asked…\nWhat do you think I look like? Can you draw a picture of me based on your perception of me?\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\nHere’s how I imagine a portrait of you metaphorically:\n\nThe Setting: A study desk with a laptop open to both NVivo and a theatre script — symbolizing your dual world of rigorous research and creativity.\nThe Figure: You sitting upright, surrounded by books with titles like AI in Education, Constructivism, and Metacognition. Your posture shows focus but also some tension, hinting at perfectionism and drive.\nThe Atmosphere: Light streaming in from one side, suggesting ambition and clarity about your goals, while the other side is softer, evoking introspection and creativity.\nSymbols Around You:\n\nA clock with multiple sticky notes (overcommitment, multitasking).\nA stage mask and music notes (theatre and music).\nA small globe or airplane (international academic identity).\nA pencil sketch on the desk half-finished (hinting at your occasional procrastination).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments: Based on its understanding from the previous two exchanges, ChatGPT integrated what it considered to be the most important elements into this portrait. Yet, for some reason, the way it depicts me feels rather somber — as if I am a weary figure buried in work at my desk — which left me a little disheartened. Although the portrait does not fully reflect everything ChatGPT initially described, it still manages to capture certain elements with reasonable accuracy. For instance, the sticky notes on the wall, the theatrical mask and musical notes, and the split laptop screen — one side showing tools I often use for qualitative content analysis, and the other side displaying a script. The three books on the desk also correspond to my current research interests. To me, this image seems more like a visual summary of ChatGPT’s earlier points rather than a comprehensive or entirely new understanding of me drawn from our broader, multi-round interactions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Part 2. Going further in prompting\nCompared to the previous round, this time I provided much more concrete and detailed requirements. I explained the purpose of designing this website, the pages it needed to include, its overall structure, and even the name I wanted for it. Unlike last time, I didn’t simply select one of the preset theme colors offered by WIX. Instead, when it came to choosing the theme color, I communicated directly with the embedded AI about my needs—namely, to create a graffiti-inspired website with plenty of collage elements and a youthful, vibrant feel – I liked that at every stage of building the site, I could interact with the AI to adjust the details.\nOnce the basics were set, I entered the site generation page. There is one clear strength which is consitent with the one in my first attempt: it followed my instructions carefully. The site was divided into two pages as I described in the promps, one for showcasing my academic work and another for my personal hobbies. Concerning the interface, the first version it produced looked just like what it generated in my first attemp, a design which looks fine but not with enough distinct. Therefore, I thought it might require more specific prompts in the design to reach to my expectation (after trying two more rounds of revisions, I realized the original draft was actually the best).\nHowever, when I tried to push it further by asking for an even more vibrant and artistic design — something bold and eye-catching — things went downhill. After refreshing my requests and feeding them back into WIX, the new results were ugly and uninspired, made up of nothing but basic shapes and lines with no sense of design.\n\n  \n\n\n\nPart 2. Trying a Different Style\nStill not satisfied, I thought, why not just switch to a completely different style — something with more existing pictures to work with? So I asked ChatGPT to help me craft a more descriptive prompt, hoping to transform the site into something with a European impressionist aesthetic.\nHere’s the prompt I used:\n\nI’m updating the design to include a classic European pattern as the background, making it more sophisticated and detailed. I’ll keep you updated on the progress.\n\nThe result? Let’s just say it was “acceptable” at best, but nowhere near something I’d adopt. It looked more like an assignment turned in by a beginner in web design than a polished, professional product.\n\nSo I decided to narrow my focus and give more specific feedback. I chose one element and asked for a precise modification with this prompt:\n\nThe design is too basic. Add classic European pattern as the background.\n\nIn theory, this should have only updated the background for that single element. But in practice, the AI modified the background of every element on the page. The first cover image looked fine, but as I scrolled further, the European patterns became denser and spread across large sections of the site. Some of the text became hard to read, and the overall impression was cluttered, mismatched, and lacking any sense of elegance.\n\n  \n\n\n\nConclusion\nThat was the moment I realized the limitations of this so-called AI website generator. It can meet basic, low-level demands, but if you’re aiming for a truly sophisticated, design-driven website, this tool simply isn’t capable of delivering.\nSo in the end, I felt like I had been a little misled by that YouTube ad. But soon after, I discovered that this tool also allows you to build a personal website by directly editing an existing template. That gave me a new idea: instead of relying on the “one-click” generator, I could start with a ready-made template that already looked polished and well-designed, and then customize it. To make the site richer, I also plan to bring in images and music generated by other AI tools. I’ll share the details of this process in my upcoming blog posts."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Part 1. Trying Out AI’s “One-Click Website”\nI started by selecting the text-to-website feature. To me, this seemed like the most beginner-friendly option — and also the feature where AI could really show its strengths. I wanted to test how effective it actually was.\n\n \n\nWIX only asked me to give a simple description of my website and it didn’t require much detail. In my first attempt,I kept it extremely brief. I just wrote one sentence: “This is a website to record my dog Apple’s growth.” Surprisingly, even from that single sentence, the AI was able to break it down and generate a full design plan, including suggested content sections and layout elements. I found this feature genuinely impressive.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, in addition to the AI’s automatically generated text-based website structure, it also offered me several theme color palettes to choose from. I picked one that I liked, and the system began generating the site.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, the overall result really impressed me. One thing I especially appreciated was that the AI didn’t just give me an empty framework waiting for me to fill in. Instead, it generated both text content and images right away, which gave me a very clear preview of what the website would actually look like once I started using it.\n\n\n\nAnother thing that impressed me was how precisely the system followed its own design outline and built out three separate pages: a homepage, a timeline, and a gallery.\nOn the timeline page, I could actually view each of my posts in chronological order.\n\n\n\nThe gallery page displayed all of my posts in one place, and it even allowed me to search for specific ones using keywords or tags. When I clicked on a post, I could see its detailed content.\n\n\n\nEven better, I was able to create new posts by uploading photos, adding a title, date, and description.\n\n\n\nAll of these buttons were functional and clickable, which gave me the impression that the site was not just a demo but a relatively mature product. It’s certainly not something a beginner in programming or web design could put together so quickly.\nOn top of that, once I switched into edit mode, I could modify every piece of text (or ask AI inserted to modify), adjust background colors, and upload my own images. In other words, the tool offered a high degree of customization.\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis was my very first attempt at using Wix’s AI website generator, and I have to admit — I was genuinely impressed. With nothing more than a single sentence, the system was able to produce a fully functional, multi-page website that included content, images, navigation, and interactive features. It gave me not just an empty shell but a site that felt surprisingly complete and ready to use, which was far beyond what I had expected.\nAt the same time, this experience also left me curious. While the generated site was impressive for a first draft, it still leaned toward a conventional and structured design. In the next entries of this blog series, I’ll explore whether it’s possible to push the tool further — to see if it can create a website that is less predictable, more experimental, and infused with stronger elements of personal style."

Regarding my previous educational background, though, some of the descriptions are entirely fabricated.\n\n\n\n\nYou are deeply skilled in qualitative and mixed-methods research, employing ethnography, thematic coding (NVivo), field notes, interviews, and screen-recording analysis. You focus on codebook reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa) and combine deductive and inductive coding. You also handle systematic reviews (PRISMA flow) and experiment with Python automation for data visualization (annotation heatmaps, linguistic metrics like Advanced Guiraud, MLTU, semantic overlap, Genbit score).\n\nComments: Since I often use ChatGPT for brainstorming during my studies and research, and frequently seek its opinions and suggestions, it has accumulated a large amount of data about my academic work. That’s why its summary and description of this part are entirely accurate. I can clearly see that the methodologies it mentioned — including NVivo, Few Notes, and interviews — are indeed the ones I have applied in my recent three research projects.\n\n\n\n\nAcross your work, you consistently explore:\n\nMetacognition: How students plan, monitor, and evaluate their use of AI in writing.\nAgency: How students negotiate autonomy, dependency, and trust in human-AI collaboration.\nEthics: Academic integrity, AI bias, adversarial risks, and responsible design.\nConstructivism and Socioculturalism: Viewing learning as an active, social process rather than passive absorption.\n\n\nComments: This part is also largely accurate, but the last item is not actually part of my research field — it was reading material from one of my courses. I don’t think ChatGPT can clearly distinguish between what comes from coursework and what comes from my academic research. Moreover, its description of my academic identity seems to be based mostly on my more recent interactions. This suggests that its memory may not prioritize drawing on older interaction data.\n\n\n\n\nYou balance your academic intensity with theatre and music, auditioning for roles (e.g., School of Rock, A Doll’s House), practicing songs, and analyzing scripts. You also enjoy visual design and photography, often blending these with academic projects (logos, covers, Ghibli-style art). You’re a curious and active traveler, weaving academic conferences (e.g., EARLI 2025 in Austria) with cultural exploration.\n\nComments: Overall, the description aligns very well with my past interactions with ChatGPT, but the same limitation remains — it seems to only cover roughly the past three months.\n\n\n\n\nIn our interactions, you’ve shown a strong preference for:\n\nAcademic precision: structured arguments, APA 7 citations, codebooks, PRISMA diagrams.\nCritical feedback: you explicitly want me to act as your academic advisor—strict and honest, not sugarcoating weaknesses.\nBilingual flexibility: you often draft in Chinese, requesting natural English translations.\nIteration: you refine outputs multiple times, pushing toward more polished and academically rigorous results.\n\n\nComments: At this point, I realize that all the traits ChatGPT summarized about me are either neutral or mostly positive. It did not mention any negative characteristics. This may be related to its underlying pre-prompt design, which tends to avoid generating content that could be perceived as overly critical or as unfavorable evaluations of the user."

    "text": "Prompts Two – Judge me\n\nI asked…\nCan you summarize five advantages and five disadvantages of me based on our previous interactions? You should focus on my personalities, qualities, habits, etc.\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\n\n🌟 Five Advantages\n\nHighly Reflective and Self-Aware\n\nYou consistently analyze your own behaviors (e.g., procrastination, motivation, workflow with GenAI) and ask whether they stem from habits, cognitive patterns, or deeper issues. This makes you quick to self-correct and grow.\n\nAmbitious and Strategic\n\nYou plan far ahead (PhD applications, research portfolio, networking with professors) and design projects with clear alignment to long-term goals. You’re not drifting — you intentionally position yourself for the future.\n\nCreative and Multidimensional\n\nYou balance rigorous research with artistic pursuits (theatre, music, design), which gives you a rare breadth. This creativity helps you design engaging educational tools and see problems from fresh angles.\n\nDetail-Oriented and Perfectionist (in a productive way)\n\nYou iterate heavily on writing, presentations, and even emails, showing you care about precision, nuance, and tone. This makes your output polished and professional.\n\nOpen and Curious\n\nYou regularly experiment with new frameworks, coding methods, and even playful activities (AI literacy lessons, game design). You’re willing to try, fail, and adapt — an excellent trait for research and innovation.\n\n\n\nComments: When responding to this prompt, ChatGPT comes across like a chef who has the necessary skills but doesn’t show a particularly rigorous or responsible attitude toward the customer. It gathered different “ingredients” — for example, knowing that I do theater, that I am learning to sing, and that I am conducting research — and then combined them into a kind of “fusion dish.” In mixing these elements together, it also started to add made-up details to make the story sound coherent and aligned with the prompt. At first glance, the result seems to reflect many of my real traits and experiences, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the overall picture doesn’t fully make sense.\n\n\n\n⚖️ Five Disadvantages\n\nTendency to Overwork and Overcommit\n\nYou juggle many projects, often pushing yourself close to exhaustion (something you’ve admitted). This risks burnout and diffuses focus.\n\nPerfectionism as a Double-Edged Sword\n\nWhile precision is a strength, your habit of endless refinement (emails, drafts, even small tasks) sometimes slows progress and creates unnecessary stress.\n\nDifficulty Letting Go of Control\n\nYou often prefer to handle tasks yourself rather than delegate or accept “good enough.” This can make collaboration slower and less balanced.\n\nEmotional Investment in Work\n\nYou sometimes tie personal validation to academic output or feedback (e.g., IRB, professor responses, auditions). This makes setbacks feel heavier than they might need to.\n\nProcrastination + Attention Shifts\n\nDespite being ambitious, you occasionally delay tasks (like drawing for friends, or course registration) due to distraction or scattered focus, which frustrates you afterward.\n\n\n\nComments: The frist four ChatGPT’s response about my “weaknesses” reads almost like the perfect copy-and-paste answer to the classic HR interview question, “What is one of your weaknesses?” — it appears to point out flaws, but in reality it is still praising me. I don’t think this reflects what I would genuinely expect or want to see as an honest account of my weaknesses."

    "text": "Prompts Three – Picture me\n\nI asked…\nWhat do you think I look like? Can you draw a picture of me based on your perception of me?\n\n\nChatGPT answered…\nHere’s how I imagine a portrait of you metaphorically:\n\nThe Setting: A study desk with a laptop open to both NVivo and a theatre script — symbolizing your dual world of rigorous research and creativity.\nThe Figure: You sitting upright, surrounded by books with titles like AI in Education, Constructivism, and Metacognition. Your posture shows focus but also some tension, hinting at perfectionism and drive.\nThe Atmosphere: Light streaming in from one side, suggesting ambition and clarity about your goals, while the other side is softer, evoking introspection and creativity.\nSymbols Around You:\n\nA clock with multiple sticky notes (overcommitment, multitasking).\nA stage mask and music notes (theatre and music).\nA small globe or airplane (international academic identity).\nA pencil sketch on the desk half-finished (hinting at your occasional procrastination).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments: Based on its understanding from the previous two exchanges, ChatGPT integrated what it considered to be the most important elements into this portrait. Yet, for some reason, the way it depicts me feels rather somber — as if I am a weary figure buried in work at my desk — which left me a little disheartened. Although the portrait does not fully reflect everything ChatGPT initially described, it still manages to capture certain elements with reasonable accuracy. For instance, the sticky notes on the wall, the theatrical mask and musical notes, and the split laptop screen — one side showing tools I often use for qualitative content analysis, and the other side displaying a script. The three books on the desk also correspond to my current research interests. To me, this image seems more like a visual summary of ChatGPT’s earlier points rather than a comprehensive or entirely new understanding of me drawn from our broader, multi-round interactions."

But when I opened the page, nothing had changed. To investigate, I opened up the DevTool of the browser, which exposed the underlying code of the site. I located the elements for the input bar in the ChatGPT interface and copied them. Then I went back to the Cline with a  question: *“I should see a button from Chrome Booster here in this section, but there’s nothing. Could you help me resolve it?”*\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n### Takeaways\nFirst, collaborating with AI to develop an extension or software is ideal for multitasking. Since AI needs time to process requirements, analyze the code, and propose the best strategy, I can use that waiting period to tackle other tasks. For example, while developing this extension, I also worked on writing this blog about the process. This not only saved time but also helped me preserve a fresh memory of the entire workflow.\n\nSecond, even though AI is capable of debugging, we still need to stay flexible and adapt to the current status of the code. Sometimes, when AI fails to achieve a goal after several attempts, it’s necessary to explore alternative solutions. For instance, I found it useful to ask AI to generate logs and then feed those logs back into the system. This gave AI a clearer picture of what had been accomplished and what went wrong. In other words, we cannot simply expect AI to finish the task on its own — we have to think critically and provide multiple options or strategies to guide it.\n\nThird, it’s important to remember to push the code once it reaches a satisfying state. If you move on to the next iteration and AI makes major changes that worsen the outcome, you’ll want to revert to the earlier version. That’s only possible if you’ve pushed it beforehand. As a bonus tip, if you’re unhappy with the current version, you can use git stash to temporarily save it in a separate place. That way, you can easily return to the most recent pushed version whenever needed."

But when I opened the page, nothing had changed. To investigate, I opened up the DevTool of the browser, which exposed the underlying code of the site. I located the elements for the input bar in the ChatGPT interface and copied them. Then I went back to the Cline with a  question: *“I should see a button from Chrome Booster here in this section, but there’s nothing. Could you help me resolve it?”*\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n### Takeaways\nFirst, collaborating with AI to develop an extension or software is ideal for multitasking. Since AI needs time to process requirements, analyze the code, and propose the best strategy, I can use that waiting period to tackle other tasks. For example, while developing this extension, I also worked on writing this blog about the process. This not only saved time but also helped me preserve a fresh memory of the entire workflow.\n\nSecond, even though AI is capable of debugging, we still need to stay flexible and adapt to the current status of the code. Sometimes, when AI fails to achieve a goal after several attempts, it’s necessary to explore alternative solutions. For instance, I found it useful to ask AI to generate logs and then feed those logs back into the system. This gave AI a clearer picture of what had been accomplished and what went wrong. In other words, we cannot simply expect AI to finish the task on its own — we have to think critically and provide multiple options or strategies to guide it.\n\nThird, it’s important to remember to push the code once it reaches a satisfying state. If you move on to the next iteration and AI makes major changes that worsen the outcome, you’ll want to revert to the earlier version. That’s only possible if you’ve pushed it beforehand. As a bonus tip, if you’re unhappy with the current version, you can use git stash to temporarily save it in a separate place. That way, you can easily return to the most recent pushed version whenever needed."
