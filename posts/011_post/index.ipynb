    "## What about other LLMs?\n",
    "Curious whether this strange “seahorse loop” was unique to ChatGPT, I asked the same question to several other models, including DeepSeek, Gemini and Claude. All of them denied the existence of a seahorse emoji and none showed the same chaotic self-correcting behavior that ChatGPT did. Claude briefly showed a tendency to self-correct, but it quickly recognized that there might not be a seahorse emoji and explicitly stated that it was unsure.\n",

    "**The Mandela Effect**: Many people confidently remember a seahorse emoji. This collective false memory is likely because seahorses are ocean creatures, and numerous other marine animals like tropical fish (🐠), sharks (🦈), and jellyfish already have their own emojis, so it seems logical that a seahorse would, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Hallucinations:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are known to struggle with this question. When asked for the seahorse emoji, they may enter a \"recursive failure loop,\" incorrectly suggesting various fish, a unicorn (🦄), or other animals before often settling on a wrong answer. This happens because the AI tries to find the closest match to \"seahorse\" in its data but has no correct token to output"
