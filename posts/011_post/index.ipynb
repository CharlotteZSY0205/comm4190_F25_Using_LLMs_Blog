    "## What about other LLMs?\n",
    "Curious whether this strange \u201cseahorse loop\u201d was unique to ChatGPT, I asked the same question to several other models, including DeepSeek, Gemini and Claude. All of them denied the existence of a seahorse emoji and none showed the same chaotic self-correcting behavior that ChatGPT did. Claude briefly showed a tendency to self-correct, but it quickly recognized that there might not be a seahorse emoji and explicitly stated that it was unsure.\n",

    "## Possible reasons\n",
    "**The Mandela Effect**: Many people confidently remember a seahorse emoji. This collective false memory is likely because seahorses are ocean creatures, and numerous other marine animals like tropical fish (\ud83d\udc20), sharks (\ud83e\udd88), and jellyfish already have their own emojis, so it seems logical that a seahorse would, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI Hallucinations:** Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are known to struggle with this question. When asked for the seahorse emoji, they may enter a \"recursive failure loop,\" incorrectly suggesting various fish, a unicorn (\ud83e\udd84), or other animals before often settling on a wrong answer. This happens because the AI tries to find the closest match to \"seahorse\" in its data but has no correct token to output"
