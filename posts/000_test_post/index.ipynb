    "\n",
    "I’m a Taylor Swift fan, and one of her songs, *Florida*, inspired me to create a small music video. Coincidentally, I’ll be visiting Orlando’s Disney World in Florida this October. I’ll be staying there for three days, and I plan to visit **Hollywood Studios**, **Magic Kingdom**, and **Animal Kingdom**.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this trip, I want to film a short MV using the following excerpt from *Florida*. My idea is to shoot scenes inside the Disney parks with my phone, matching them as closely as possible to the imagery in the lyrics. For parts of the song that are harder to visualize literally, I’m fine with using creative interpretation and artistic freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I need from you is a **very detailed script** that covers every aspect of the filming process. This should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outfit choices and styling for each scene\n",
    "* Props I should prepare\n",
    "* Specific Disney locations for each lyric line\n",
    "* Suggested camera angles and framing\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, since I’m a devoted Swiftie, it would be even better if the outfits, props, or chosen locations include subtle references to Taylor herself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the lyrics I want to use for the video:\n",
    "\n",
    ">I need to forget, so take me to Florida\n",
    ">\n",
    ">I’ve got some regrets, I’ll bury them in Florida\n",
