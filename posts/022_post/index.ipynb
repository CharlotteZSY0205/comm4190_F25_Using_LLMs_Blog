    "## Casting the AI\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"cover.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nIn *Co-Intelligence*, Ethan Mollick introduces a concept that initially felt counterintuitive: treat AI like a person. Not because it *is* a person, but because it performs better when you give it a persona. \n\nI used to treat ChatGPT like a search engine\u2014asking it direct questions and expecting direct answers. But Mollick suggests we should 'cast' the AI in a role. Instead of saying 'summarize this', say 'You are a world-class editor. Summarize this for a busy executive.' The difference in quality is staggering.\n\n### The Power of the Mask\n\nWhen you give an AI a persona, you are essentially narrowing its focus. You are telling it which parts of its vast training data to prioritize. It\u2019s like putting a mask on the 'alien mind' we talked about in a previous post. \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"mask.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nI\u2019ve started using this for everything. When I\u2019m coding, I tell the AI it\u2019s a 'senior software architect with a focus on security'. When I\u2019m writing, I tell it it\u2019s a 'critical but supportive writing coach'. Each persona brings a different 'vibe' and a different set of priorities to the conversation.\n\n### Beyond Simple Instructions\n\nThe real magic happens when you give the persona a specific goal and a set of constraints. Mollick shares an example of asking an AI to be a 'pompous, self-important' critic. The results are not only helpful but also entertaining. \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"persona.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nI tried this myself. I asked Claude to be a 'skeptical futurist' and critique my latest blog post. It was brutal. It pointed out assumptions I hadn't realized I was making and pushed me to think more deeply about the long-term implications of AI. It was exactly what I needed.\n\n### The Human in the Director's Chair\n\nThis shift in perspective has made me realize that my role in the co-intelligence partnership is that of a **Director**. I\u2019m not just a user; I\u2019m a casting director, a scriptwriter, and an editor. I have to know which persona to call on for which task, and I have to know how to guide that persona toward the best outcome.\n\nTreating AI like a person doesn't mean forgetting it\u2019s a machine. It means understanding the machine\u2019s 'psychology' well enough to get the most out of it. By using personas, we can turn a general-purpose tool into a specialized team of experts. And as I\u2019m learning, that\u2019s where the real power of AI lies."
