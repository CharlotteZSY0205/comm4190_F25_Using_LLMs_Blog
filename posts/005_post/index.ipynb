    "### The Initial Idea\n",
    "I have a specific idea of what the extension should be like. I described to ChatGPT what I had in mind: the target users, the workflow, and the main functions. Instead of asking for code right away, I requested a detailed, code-free design document. This gave me a clear blueprint of what the extension should do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bringing in Cline\n",
    "I conducted the entire development process inside Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which became the central workspace for building my extension. To make this possible, I relied on an open-source coding agent called Cline. Unlike simple autocomplete tools, Cline is an agentic coding tool that integrates directly with editors like VS Code to perform complex, multi-step tasks. It can understand entire codebases, plan and implement sophisticated changes, and execute tasks by reading and editing files, running terminal commands, and even browsing the web\u2014once you grant it permission. In other words, it functions more like a true coding collaborator than a mere assistant. \n",

    "In my workflow, I primarily used two large language models. The first was GPT-5 Codex, which I chose for generating the initial foundation of my project. It\u2019s currently one of the most powerful models for coding tasks, and I trusted it to establish a strong base by producing the first version of the code. After that, I switched to GPT-5 for the following iterations and refinements. This was mainly a practical decision because GPT-5 is more cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "I fed them the document and asked them to generate the base code. Codex went all out\u2014it wrote nearly a thousand lines of code and produced several files that I honestly couldn\u2019t make sense of at first. So I asked the agent to provide me with a **step-by-step file instructing me on how to install the extension in Chrome**. It did exactly that, using clear natural language, and everything went smoothly\u2014at least for the most part. \n",

    "PromptBooster Extension Installation Guide\n",
    "This guide will walk you through installing the PromptBooster browser extension step by step. This extension works on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. If you're new to browser extensions, don't worry\u2014this is straightforward!\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "* A computer with Google Chrome or another Chromium-based browser (like Edge or Brave) installed.\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with your operating system (e.g., how to open folders and run commands).\n",
    "* (Optional) Node.js installed on your system if you need to build the extension from source. You can download it from\u00a0nodejs.org\u00a0if it's not already installed.\n",
    "Note:\u00a0If you're installing a pre-built version, you don't need Node.js. Check if the repository has a built version (no\u00a0dist\u00a0folder visible? You may need to build).\n",
    "Step 1: Download the Extension Code\n",
    "1. Go to the GitHub repository for PromptBooster:\u00a0https://github.com/CharlotteZSY0205/PromptBooster.\n",
    "2. Click the green \"Code\" button.\n",
    "3. Select \"Download ZIP\" to download the source code as a ZIP file.\n",
    "4. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your computer (e.g., Desktop or Documents). This folder will be your extension's root directory.\n",
    "Alternatively, if you have Git installed:\n",
    "* Open a terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "* Run:\u00a0git clone https://github.com/CharlotteZSY0205/PromptBooster.git\n",
    "* Navigate to the cloned folder.\n",
    "Step 2: (Optional) Build the Extension\n",
    "The extension might need to be built from source code. Check if there's a\u00a0dist\u00a0or\u00a0build\u00a0folder in the unzipped/cloned directory. If not, or if you see source files like\u00a0.js\u00a0in\u00a0src/, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the extension's root folder (where\u00a0package.json\u00a0is located).\n",
    "    * Example:\u00a0cd Desktop/PromptBooster\u00a0(adjust based on where you unzipped it).\n",
    "3. Install dependencies (if any):\n",
    "    * Run:\u00a0npm install\n",
    "    * This might take a minute. It's setting up tools for building.\n",
    "4. Build the extension:\n",
    "    * Run:\u00a0npm run build\n",
    "    * This compiles the source into a ready-to-use version. If it fails, the extension might not need building\u2014proceed to Step 3.\n",
    "Tip for Novices:\u00a0If you see an error, try skipping to Step 3. Many extensions don't need building if they're simple injects.\n",
    "Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser\n",
    "For Google Chrome:\n",
    "1. Open Google Chrome.\n",
    "2. Type\u00a0chrome://extensions/\u00a0in the address bar and press Enter.\n",
    "3. In the top-right corner, toggle on \"Developer mode.\"\n",
    "4. Click the \"Load unpacked\" button.\n",
    "5. Select the extension's root folder (the one with\u00a0manifest.json\u00a0inside). If you built it, select the\u00a0dist\u00a0or\u00a0build\u00a0folder if it exists; otherwise, select the main folder.\n",
    "6. The extension should now appear in your list of extensions with the name \"PromptBooster.\"\n",
    "For Microsoft Edge:\n",
    "1. Open Microsoft Edge.\n",
    "2. Type\u00a0edge://extensions/\u00a0in the address bar and press Enter.\n",
    "3. In the bottom-left corner, toggle on \"Developer mode.\"\n",
    "4. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the extension's root folder as above.\n",
    "5. It should load similarly to Chrome.\n",
    "For Firefox:\n",
    "Warning:\u00a0The extension is built for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge). For Firefox, it needs conversion to an older format, which is more advanced. If you're a novice, consider using Chrome instead. If you must use Firefox, search for \"convert Chrome extension to Firefox\" or ask for help in forums.\n",
    "Step 4: Configure the Extension\n",
    "1. After loading, find the PromptBooster extension in your extensions list (still on the\u00a0chrome://extensions\u00a0page).\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Details\" button next to it.\n",
    "3. Click \"Extension options\" to open the settings page.\n",
    "4. Here, you'll need to set up:\n",
    "    * API Key:\u00a0Paste your API key from an OpenAI-compatible provider (e.g., OpenAI or a service like Grok).\n",
    "    * API Endpoint URL:\u00a0The URL for your provider's API (defaults are usually fine).\n",
    "    * Model:\u00a0Select the model you want to use for rewriting (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
    "    * Default Mode:\u00a0Choose your preferred mode (Learning Mode is recommended for beginners).\n",
    "    * Preview Option:\u00a0Toggle whether you want to see the rewritten prompt before sending it. Enable this if you're unsure about changes.\n",
    "5. Save your settings.\n",
    "Tip:\u00a0Get an API key from OpenAI's website if you don't have one. Sign up and get one from their API section.\n",
    "Step 5: Test the Extension\n",
    "1. Go to\u00a0ChatGPT's website\u00a0(or another supported chatbot).\n",
    "2. Make sure you're logged in.\n",
    "3. Type a prompt in the chat box, like: \"Tell me about dogs.\"\n",
    "4. You should see a new \"Boost Prompt\" button next to the \"Send\" button.\n",
    "5. Click \"Boost Prompt\" to let the extension rewrite and send an improved version.\n",
    "    * If preview is enabled, you'll see the rewritten prompt first and can edit or approve it.\n",
    "6. In the chat history, you'll see your original prompt (in gray) and the boosted one.\n",
    "Troubleshooting\n",
    "* Extension not loading?\u00a0Make sure you selected the correct folder (where\u00a0manifest.json\u00a0is). If built, use the\u00a0dist\u00a0folder.\n",
    "* API errors?\u00a0Double-check your API key, endpoint, and model in settings.\n",
    "* Button not showing?\u00a0Refresh the page or make sure you're on chat.openai.com. The extension only works on specific sites.\n",
    "* Build failed?\u00a0Skip building and try loading the source directly\u2014many simple extensions work without it.\n",
    "* Permission issues?\u00a0The extension needs permissions for storage and active tabs. Grant them when prompted.\n",
    "What's Next?\n",
    "Once installed, explore the different modes in settings: Learning Mode, Structured Mode, etc. Refer to the README.md for more features.\n",
    "If you encounter issues, feel free to ask for help or check the GitHub repository for updates.\n",
    "Happy prompting! \ud83d\ude80\n",

    "### Takeaways\n",
    "First, collaborating with AI to develop an extension or software is ideal for multitasking. Since AI needs time to process requirements, analyze the code, and propose the best strategy, I can use that waiting period to tackle other tasks. For example, while developing this extension, I also worked on writing this blog about the process. This not only saved time but also helped me preserve a fresh memory of the entire workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, even though AI is capable of debugging, we still need to stay flexible and adapt to the current status of the code. Sometimes, when AI fails to achieve a goal after several attempts, it\u2019s necessary to explore alternative solutions. For instance, I found it useful to ask AI to generate logs and then feed those logs back into the system. This gave AI a clearer picture of what had been accomplished and what went wrong. In other words, we cannot simply expect AI to finish the task on its own \u2014 we have to think critically and provide multiple options or strategies to guide it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, it\u2019s important to remember to push the code once it reaches a satisfying state. If you move on to the next iteration and AI makes major changes that worsen the outcome, you\u2019ll want to revert to the earlier version. That\u2019s only possible if you\u2019ve pushed it beforehand. As a bonus tip, if you\u2019re unhappy with the current version, you can use git stash to temporarily save it in a separate place. That way, you can easily return to the most recent pushed version whenever needed.\n",
