    "I conducted the entire development process inside Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which became the central workspace for building my extension. To make this possible, I relied on an open-source coding agent called Cline. Unlike simple autocomplete tools, Cline is an agentic coding tool that integrates directly with editors like VS Code to perform complex, multi-step tasks. It can understand entire codebases, plan and implement sophisticated changes, and execute tasks by reading and editing files, running terminal commands, and even browsing the web—once you grant it permission. In other words, it functions more like a true coding collaborator than a mere assistant. In my workflow, I primarily used two large language models. The first was GPT-5 Codex, which I chose for generating the initial foundation of my project. It’s currently one of the most powerful models for coding tasks, and I trusted it to establish a strong base by producing the first version of the code. After that, I switched to GPT-5 for the following iterations and refinements. This was mainly a practical decision because GPT-5 is more cost-effective.\n",

    "### Debugging with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, I ran into some roadblocks and I leaned on the AI to try to resolve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\\[Insert prompt here]*\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I asked the agent to provide me with a **step-by-step file instructing me on how to install the extension in Chrome**. It did exactly that, using clear natural language, and everything went smoothly—at least for the most part. \n",

    "PromptBooster Extension Installation Guide\n",
    "This guide will walk you through installing the PromptBooster browser extension step by step. This extension works on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers. If you're new to browser extensions, don't worry—this is straightforward!\n",
    "Prerequisites\n",
    "* A computer with Google Chrome or another Chromium-based browser (like Edge or Brave) installed.\n",
    "* Basic familiarity with your operating system (e.g., how to open folders and run commands).\n",
    "* (Optional) Node.js installed on your system if you need to build the extension from source. You can download it from nodejs.org if it's not already installed.\n",
    "Note: If you're installing a pre-built version, you don't need Node.js. Check if the repository has a built version (no dist folder visible? You may need to build).\n",
    "Step 1: Download the Extension Code\n",
    "1. Go to the GitHub repository for PromptBooster: https://github.com/CharlotteZSY0205/PromptBooster.\n",
    "2. Click the green \"Code\" button.\n",
    "3. Select \"Download ZIP\" to download the source code as a ZIP file.\n",
    "4. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder on your computer (e.g., Desktop or Documents). This folder will be your extension's root directory.\n",
    "Alternatively, if you have Git installed:\n",
    "* Open a terminal/command prompt.\n",
    "* Run: git clone https://github.com/CharlotteZSY0205/PromptBooster.git\n",
    "* Navigate to the cloned folder.\n",
    "Step 2: (Optional) Build the Extension\n",
    "The extension might need to be built from source code. Check if there's a dist or build folder in the unzipped/cloned directory. If not, or if you see source files like .js in src/, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the extension's root folder (where package.json is located).\n",
    "    * Example: cd Desktop/PromptBooster (adjust based on where you unzipped it).\n",
    "3. Install dependencies (if any):\n",
    "    * Run: npm install\n",
    "    * This might take a minute. It's setting up tools for building.\n",
    "4. Build the extension:\n",
    "    * Run: npm run build\n",
    "    * This compiles the source into a ready-to-use version. If it fails, the extension might not need building—proceed to Step 3.\n",
    "Tip for Novices: If you see an error, try skipping to Step 3. Many extensions don't need building if they're simple injects.\n",
    "Step 3: Load the Extension into Your Browser\n",
    "For Google Chrome:\n",
    "1. Open Google Chrome.\n",
    "2. Type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar and press Enter.\n",
    "3. In the top-right corner, toggle on \"Developer mode.\"\n",
    "4. Click the \"Load unpacked\" button.\n",
    "5. Select the extension's root folder (the one with manifest.json inside). If you built it, select the dist or build folder if it exists; otherwise, select the main folder.\n",
    "6. The extension should now appear in your list of extensions with the name \"PromptBooster.\"\n",
    "For Microsoft Edge:\n",
    "1. Open Microsoft Edge.\n",
    "2. Type edge://extensions/ in the address bar and press Enter.\n",
    "3. In the bottom-left corner, toggle on \"Developer mode.\"\n",
    "4. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the extension's root folder as above.\n",
    "5. It should load similarly to Chrome.\n",
    "For Firefox:\n",
    "Warning: The extension is built for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge). For Firefox, it needs conversion to an older format, which is more advanced. If you're a novice, consider using Chrome instead. If you must use Firefox, search for \"convert Chrome extension to Firefox\" or ask for help in forums.\n",
    "Step 4: Configure the Extension\n",
    "1. After loading, find the PromptBooster extension in your extensions list (still on the chrome://extensions page).\n",
    "2. Click on the \"Details\" button next to it.\n",
    "3. Click \"Extension options\" to open the settings page.\n",
    "4. Here, you'll need to set up:\n",
    "    * API Key: Paste your API key from an OpenAI-compatible provider (e.g., OpenAI or a service like Grok).\n",
    "    * API Endpoint URL: The URL for your provider's API (defaults are usually fine).\n",
    "    * Model: Select the model you want to use for rewriting (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
    "    * Default Mode: Choose your preferred mode (Learning Mode is recommended for beginners).\n",
    "    * Preview Option: Toggle whether you want to see the rewritten prompt before sending it. Enable this if you're unsure about changes.\n",
    "5. Save your settings.\n",
    "Tip: Get an API key from OpenAI's website if you don't have one. Sign up and get one from their API section.\n",
    "Step 5: Test the Extension\n",
    "1. Go to ChatGPT's website (or another supported chatbot).\n",
    "2. Make sure you're logged in.\n",
    "3. Type a prompt in the chat box, like: \"Tell me about dogs.\"\n",
    "4. You should see a new \"Boost Prompt\" button next to the \"Send\" button.\n",
    "5. Click \"Boost Prompt\" to let the extension rewrite and send an improved version.\n",
    "    * If preview is enabled, you'll see the rewritten prompt first and can edit or approve it.\n",
    "6. In the chat history, you'll see your original prompt (in gray) and the boosted one.\n",
    "Troubleshooting\n",
    "* Extension not loading? Make sure you selected the correct folder (where manifest.json is). If built, use the dist folder.\n",
    "* API errors? Double-check your API key, endpoint, and model in settings.\n",
    "* Button not showing? Refresh the page or make sure you're on chat.openai.com. The extension only works on specific sites.\n",
    "* Build failed? Skip building and try loading the source directly—many simple extensions work without it.\n",
    "* Permission issues? The extension needs permissions for storage and active tabs. Grant them when prompted.\n",
    "What's Next?\n",
    "Once installed, explore the different modes in settings: Learning Mode, Structured Mode, etc. Refer to the README.md for more features.\n",
    "If you encounter issues, feel free to ask for help or check the GitHub repository for updates.\n",
    "Happy prompting! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, I encountered a series of smaller but very real questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem came right at the beginning: on the **extension builder page in Quorum**, I didn’t even know which file I was supposed to select to add my extension. I asked the agent, and it clarified that it wasn’t the `manifest.json` file itself I needed to choose—it was the entire folder containing that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 18px;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"2.png\" style=\"width:40%; max-height:600px; object-fit:contain;\"/>\n",
    "  <div style=\"flex:1;\">\n",
    "    <mark>Later, after completing the installation, I expected to see some elements of my extension appear on the ChatGPT website. But when I opened the page, nothing had changed. To investigate, I opened up the DevTool of the browser, which exposed the underlying code of the site. I located the elements for the input bar in the ChatGPT interface and copied them. Then I went back to the Cline with a  question: *“I should see a button from Chrome Booster here in this section, but there’s nothing. Could you help me resolve it?”*\n",

    "The AI took over from there, diagnosing the situation and proposing fixes that helped me move forward. It was almost as if the AI was reading my screen alongside me, guiding me through technical terrain I could never have navigated alone.\n",

    "  <img src=\"4cover.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2. Trying a Different Style\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Still not satisfied, I thought, why not just switch to a completely different style — something with more existing pictures to work with? So I asked ChatGPT to help me craft a more descriptive prompt, hoping to transform the site into something with a European impressionist aesthetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the prompt I used:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I'm updating the design to include a classic European pattern as the background, making it more sophisticated and detailed. I'll keep you updated on the progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result? Let’s just say it was “acceptable” at best, but nowhere near something I’d adopt. It looked more like an assignment turned in by a beginner in web design than a polished, professional product.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"4cover.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to narrow my focus and give more specific feedback. I chose one element and asked for a precise modification with this prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The design is too basic. Add classic European pattern as the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, this should have only updated the background for that single element. But in practice, the AI modified the background of every element on the page. The first cover image looked fine, but as I scrolled further, the European patterns became denser and spread across large sections of the site. Some of the text became hard to read, and the overall impression was cluttered, mismatched, and lacking any sense of elegance.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 16px; align-items: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"c.png\" width=\"35%\"/>\n",
    "  <img src=\"c2.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "  <img src=\"c3.png\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "That was the moment I realized the limitations of this so-called AI website generator. It can meet basic, low-level demands, but if you’re aiming for a truly sophisticated, design-driven website, this tool simply isn’t capable of delivering.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the end, I felt like I had been a little misled by that YouTube ad. But soon after, I discovered that this tool also allows you to build a personal website by directly editing an existing template. That gave me a new idea: instead of relying on the “one-click” generator, I could start with a ready-made template that already looked polished and well-designed, and then customize it. To make the site richer, I also plan to bring in images and music generated by other AI tools. I’ll share the details of this process in my upcoming blog posts.\n",
