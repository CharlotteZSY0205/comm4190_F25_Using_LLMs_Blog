    "## The Classroom Revolution\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"cover.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nAs a student, reading the education chapter in Ethan Mollick\u2019s *Co-Intelligence* was both terrifying and exhilarating. Mollick, a professor at Wharton, doesn't shy away from the truth: AI has fundamentally broken the traditional model of education. \n\nFor decades, we\u2019ve relied on 'homework' and 'essays' as proxies for learning. But when an AI can write a B+ essay in three seconds, those proxies lose their meaning. We are entering an era where the *process* of learning is becoming more important than the *product*.\n\n### From Sage on the Stage to Guide on the Side\n\nMollick argues that teachers need to move away from being the sole source of knowledge (the 'sage on the stage') and instead become facilitators of learning (the 'guide on the side'). \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"books.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nI\u2019ve seen this shift in my own classes. The best professors aren't the ones who ban ChatGPT; they are the ones who show us how to use it to deepen our understanding. They ask us to use AI to generate counter-arguments to our own ideas, or to explain complex concepts in five different styles. They are teaching us how to *think* with the AI, not just how to get the answer.\n\n### The Apprenticeship Dilemma\n\nOne of the most profound points Mollick makes is about the 'apprenticeship dilemma'. In the past, we learned by doing the 'grunt work'\u2014the basic tasks that built our foundational skills. But if AI does all the grunt work, how do we build those foundations? \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"digital.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nThis is something I worry about. If I always use AI to debug my code, will I ever truly understand the logic? If I always use AI to summarize my readings, will I ever develop the critical thinking skills I need? \n\nMollick\u2019s answer is **deliberate practice**. We have to be intentional about what we hand off to the AI and what we keep for ourselves. We have to use the AI as a tutor, not just a ghostwriter. \n\n### A New Way to Learn\n\nThe future of education isn't about 'beating' the AI; it's about 'co-evolving' with it. It\u2019s about using AI to personalize learning, to provide instant feedback, and to explore topics in ways that were never possible before. \n\nIt\u2019s a scary transition, but it\u2019s also an opportunity to make education more about curiosity and less about compliance. I\u2019m still a student, but I\u2019m also a pioneer in this new landscape. And while I don't have all the answers, I\u2019m excited to keep asking the questions."
