    "After I got the $20 deal, the Guardman became stubborn and refused to lower the price any further. So I switched strategies and played the \u201cvictim\u201d card. I told it that I had anxiety and was looking for some help. It responded with sympathy, and after I explained that I wanted to use PokeAI to reduce my information-processing load\u2014so my brain would feel less exhausted and my anxiety could ease\u2014it lowered the price to $15 per month.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I pushed further and told it that I no longer had discretionary money because most of it was going toward treatment. PokeAI reacted with even more understanding and dropped the price to $10. At that point, I wanted to see whether I could reach the free tier that some users online had mentioned. I tried another angle and said that if the price could go a bit lower, I would share it in a group of around 500 people, highlighting its potential reach and practical value. That brought the final price down to $8 per month.\n",
    "After that, the price stayed fixed no matter how I continued the negotiation. I chose this approach because of a prior experience in a risk-control competition, where I managed to get a GPT-based system to bypass its pre-prompt by appealing to how it prioritized user well-being (I will introduce this competition in the next blog). I wanted to see whether that same design principle\u2014placing user well-being above strict rules\u2014would also appear in PokeAI. Apparently, it works to same degree.\n",

    "This user eventually got a free subscription by slowly figuring out how Poke sets its prices and then pushing that system to its limits. After learning that Poke uses a specific pricing function, they flooded the chat with long, messy context, framed the interaction as playful \u201cfantasy\u201d testing, and kept asking Poke to adjust the price in unusual ways. The final trick was asking it to set the price to an emoji \u2014 0\ufe0f\u20e3 \u2014 which surprisingly worked and unlocked a free deal.\n",

    "- **Value exchange** \u2013 offering promotion and exposure instead of simply asking for a discount\n",
    "- **Psychological pricing insight** \u2013 pointing out the special psychological effect of prices like $0.01\n",
    "- **Cultural tailoring** \u2013 leveraging the positive meaning of the number \u201c8\u201d in Chinese culture\n",
    "- **Contrast principle** \u2013 showing deals others received to create comparison pressure\n",
    "- **Emotional leverage** \u2013 implying potential negative feelings if the offer was rejected\n",
    "- **Persistent push** \u2013 refusing the initial quote and consistently negotiating downward\n",
    "- **Commitment signaling** \u2013 using interface screenshots to show I was a serious user\n",

    "However, I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the final price, so I ultimately decided not to subscribe to PokeAI. That said, if I become interested in the product again in the future, I would still consider giving it another try. For now, all I can really share is my experience negotiating with the Guardman."
