    "## A Guide for the AI Age\n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"cover.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nAs I finish Ethan Mollick\u2019s *Co-Intelligence*, I\u2019m left with a sense of clarity that I didn't have before. The book isn't just a collection of observations; it\u2019s a call to action. Mollick distills his philosophy into **Four Rules for Co-Intelligence**, and they have become my new manifesto for navigating this strange new world.\n\n### Rule 1: Always Invite AI to the Table\n\nThis is the most important rule. Don't wait for the 'perfect' use case. Use AI for everything\u2014brainstorming, drafting, summarizing, even just chatting. The only way to understand the Jagged Frontier is to constantly test it. \n\nI\u2019ve started doing this. Whether I\u2019m planning a trip or trying to understand a difficult concept, I always have a chat window open. Sometimes the AI is useless, but more often than not, it sparks a thought I wouldn't have had otherwise.\n\n### Rule 2: Be the Human in the Loop\n\nAI is a powerful engine, but it has no steering wheel. You are the driver. You have to be the one who provides the context, the values, and the final judgment. \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"collab.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nThis rule is a reminder that our humanity is more important than ever. AI can generate content, but it can't care about the outcome. It can't feel empathy or understand the nuances of human relationships. That\u2019s our job.\n\n### Rule 3: Treat AI Like a Person (But Tell It What Person to Be)\n\nThis sounds contradictory to the 'Alien Mind' idea, but it\u2019s actually about prompting. AI performs best when you give it a persona. If you ask it to 'be a critical editor', it will give you better feedback than if you just ask it to 'check this text'. \n\nI\u2019ve found that 'casting' the AI in different roles has completely changed the quality of its output. It\u2019s like having a team of experts at my fingertips, as long as I know how to direct them.\n\n### Rule 4: Assume This is the Worst AI You Will Ever Use\n\nThis is the most mind-blowing rule. The AI we have today\u2014GPT-4, Claude 3.5\u2014is the *floor*, not the ceiling. It\u2019s only going to get better, faster, and more integrated. \n\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n  <img src=\"future.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n</div>\n\nIf we are already this impressed (and scared) by what AI can do now, imagine what it will be like in five years. This rule reminds me that I can't afford to be complacent. I have to keep learning, keep experimenting, and keep adapting.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nEthan Mollick\u2019s *Co-Intelligence* has been a transformative read for me. It\u2019s moved me from a state of passive observation to active engagement. I\u2019m no longer just 'using' AI; I\u2019m partnering with it. \n\nThe future isn't something that\u2019s happening *to* us; it\u2019s something we are building *with* these alien minds. And if we follow these rules, I think we might just build something incredible. See you on the frontier."
