    "## The Death of Writer's Block\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"cover.jpg\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Co-Intelligence*, Ethan Mollick makes a bold claim: writer's block is effectively dead. With an LLM at your side, you never have to stare at a blank page again. You can always ask the AI for ten ideas, a starting sentence, or a different perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has been my experience over the last few months. Whenever I feel stuck, I don't wait for inspiration to strike. I 'invite the AI to the table'. I might ask it to 'argue against my main point' or 'rewrite this paragraph in the style of a 19th-century novelist'. The goal isn't to use the AI's output directly, but to use it as a spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Idea Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Mollick describes AI as an 'idea machine'. It’s not that the AI is 'creative' in the human sense—it doesn't have lived experiences or emotions. But it has access to a vast combinatorial space of human ideas. It can connect concepts that a human might never think to link.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"brainstorm.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve started using AI for 'divergent thinking'. If I’m working on a project, I’ll ask the AI for 20 weird, off-the-wall suggestions. 18 of them will be garbage. One will be okay. But one will be a 'black swan'—an idea so strange and brilliant that it changes the entire direction of the project. That’s the power of co-intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redefining Originality\n",
    "\n",
    "This partnership raises a difficult question: if the AI gave me the idea, is it still 'my' work? Mollick argues that we need to redefine originality. In the AI age, originality isn't about being the sole source of an idea; it's about being the curator, the editor, and the one who provides the final 'human' touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"creative.png\" width=\"70%\" />\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve come to see my role as a 'creative director'. I set the vision, I provide the constraints, and I decide which of the AI's suggestions are worth pursuing. The AI is my 'intern'—a very fast, very well-read, but sometimes very confused intern. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Future of Creativity\n",
    "\n",
    "The most profound takeaway from this chapter is that AI doesn't replace creativity; it scales it. It allows us to explore more ideas, faster, and with less friction. It lowers the barrier to entry for creative work, allowing more people to express themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it also raises the bar. When everyone has access to an 'idea machine', the value of a 'good' idea goes down. The value of a 'great' idea—one that is deeply human, emotionally resonant, and perfectly executed—goes up. \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m still learning how to be a good partner to my AI. It’s a dance of giving and taking, of leading and following. But one thing is clear: the blank page is no longer my enemy. It’s just a playground where I and my alien partner get to work."
