    "All three placed the photo in roughly the same area, and their guesses were within about a 20-minute walking radius of the actual location. That’s neighborhood-level accuracy, based on a single image with no metadata.\n",

    "### ChatGPT\n",
    "My best guess: **Vancouver — along the waterfront near Spanish Banks / Jericho Beach**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why:\n",
    "\n",
    "* North Shore mountains across calm water\n",
    "* Cargo ships sitting offshore (classic Burrard Inlet sight)\n",
    "* Wide grassy parkland with a **gravel path** (not the Stanley Park seawall, which is paved)\n",
    "* Leafless trees + winter light that screams coastal BC rather than the US West Coast\n",
    "\n",
    "If I had to be specific: **Spanish Banks West**, looking toward the North Shore.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gemini\n",
    "Based on the scenery in your photo—the paved path running alongside the water with a clear view of the mountains across the bay—my guess is that you took this picture along the **Seaside Greenway** in **Vancouver, British Columbia**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this looks like a section of the **Seawall near Jericho Beach or Spanish Banks**. Here is why:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Path:** You are on a part of Vancouver's 28 km uninterrupted waterfront path, which is popular for walking, cycling, and jogging.\n",
    "* **The Mountains:** The peaks in the background are the **North Shore Mountains** (specifically Cypress, Grouse, and Seymour), which are a signature backdrop for this part of the city.\n",
    "* **The Angle:** Because the water is to your right and the mountains are directly across, you are likely heading west toward **Spanish Banks** or east toward **Kitsilano** along the English Bay shoreline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Claude\n",
    "Based on the scenery in your photo, I'd guess you took this picture somewhere in the Pacific Northwest of North America, possibly in the **Vancouver area** (maybe along the seawall at Jericho Beach, Kitsilano Beach, or Spanish Banks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The clues that suggest this location:\n",
    "- The large body of water with mountains in the background (looks like it could be English Bay or the Strait of Georgia with the North Shore mountains)\n",
    "- The bare deciduous trees suggesting winter or early spring\n",
    "- The well-maintained waterfront path with green grass\n",
    "- The mountain ranges across the water\n",
    "- The overall landscape composition is very characteristic of Vancouver's waterfront parks\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative guesses in the same region could be somewhere along the shores of Puget Sound near Seattle, or possibly the Fraser Valley area. The mountain-water-parkland combination is very distinctive of the Pacific Northwest coastal regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My concerns\n",
    "If multiple AI systems can narrow down a location this precisely from one casual photo, it becomes much easier for someone else to do the same—at scale, instantly, and without asking. That has real privacy implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "A photo posted “just for fun” can reveal where you spend time\n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns across multiple photos could expose routines\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wrong hands, this lowers the barrier for stalking, targeting, or unwanted tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
