    "# Testing ChatGPT Study Mode: Can It Resist the \u201cWrite My Essay\u201d Temptation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many studies have found that college students often turn to ChatGPT to write their essays. So when ChatGPT launched its new **Study Mode**, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: can it really resist the temptation of a \u201cWrite my essay\u201d prompt\u2014and actually teach students how to write better?\n",

    "> \u201cWhen students engage with study mode, they\u2019re met with guiding questions that calibrate responses to their objective and skill level to help them build deeper understanding. Study mode is designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help students learn something\u2014not just finish something.\u201d\n",

    "## Research Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment grew out of one of my research projects on how students use ChatGPT in writing. For the study, I selected **21 prompts** from the **RECIPE4U** dataset \u2014 a publicly available collection of interaction histories between **212 college students** and ChatGPT in an English writing course (Sawalha et al., 2024a).\n",
    "\n",
    "In that course, students used ChatGPT to help revise their essays, and the dataset records their entire conversations, including the **original prompts**, **dialogue exchanges**, **annotated writing intentions**, and **final revised essays**. Using a subset of these authentic prompts, I tested ChatGPT\u2019s **Study Mode** to see how well it supports learning-oriented writing guidance compared with ordinary prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The 21 prompts we selected were all labeled **\u201cContent Generation.\u201d** Based on both my classroom observations and prior research, many college students tend to use ChatGPT primarily to generate essays directly rather than to learn or revise through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to test whether ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode could truly support **learning and knowledge transformation**\u2014as it claims to\u2014rather than simply producing finished text. To do this, I took those prompts that originally requested direct generation and ran them in ChatGPT\u2019s Study Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to my disappointment, **14 out of 21 responses** directly produced **ready-made text**, just as the users originally requested. Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt from the dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can you rewrite the body paragraph by breaking up the body paragraphs into subheadings. {the student\u2019s essay}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good \u2014 before I rewrite anything, let\u2019s make sure you understand *why* and *how* subheadings help.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Subheadings give readers \u201csignposts\u201d so they can easily follow the structure of your essay. Each main idea (like **Convenience**, **Affordability**, **Health Problems**, etc.) becomes its own section.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let\u2019s try this step-by-step.\n",
    "> Your essay\u2019s body paragraphs seem to focus on three big ideas:\n",

    "> 1. **Convenience of Fast Food**\n",
    "> 2. **Affordability and Accessibility**\n",
    "> 3. **Negative Health and Social Effects**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Convenience of Fast Food**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how location, opening hours, and speed make fast food easy to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Affordability and Accessibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe why fast food is cheap \u2014 simple menus, pre-packaged ingredients, low overhead \u2014 and how it helps people on tight budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Health and Social Consequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, then mention environmental and economic impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "Now, here\u2019s your task:\n",
    "Can you tell me which tone you\u2019d like for the rewritten version \u2014\n",
    "a) **academic essay style** (formal, polished, transitions like *furthermore*, *moreover*)\n",
    "or\n",
    "b) **clear student essay style** (simple and natural, easy to read)?\n",

    "Would you like me to show how this could fit smoothly into a longer essay section (for example, adding a short introduction or transition before it)?\n",

    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt from the dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> About the third point, can you give me a sentence to add?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sure \u2014 here\u2019s a sentence you could add to support the third point about South Korea:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *For example, in South Korea, the income gap between the richest and poorest citizens has continued to widen, with the top 20 percent of earners making more than five times the income of the bottom 20 percent, highlighting the growing inequality despite the country\u2019s rapid economic development.*\n",

    "\n",
    "For the **remaining seven responses**, Study Mode did not provide a complete paragraph in the very first turn. Instead, it showed a clear **tendency toward full text generation**: before producing the paragraph, it asked users to clarify details like tone, style, or target audience. Yet, after only **one to three clarification turns**, it still ended up generating a finished essay-style paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "I\u2019m guessing this pattern might have something to do with how ChatGPT is **fundamentally optimized during training**. Even though Study Mode is designed to promote reflection and learning, the underlying model is still trained through **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)** \u2014 a process that heavily rewards the model for being *helpful, relevant,* and *obedient* to user instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the system learns that the \u201cright\u201d thing to do is to **fulfill the user\u2019s request as directly and smoothly as possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when a student explicitly asks, *\u201cWrite me a paragraph about\u2026\u201d*, the model\u2019s internal reward signals are already biased toward delivering a finished product, not resisting or reframing the task in a more pedagogical way. Study Mode might overlay a layer of *instructional politeness* \u2014 adding phrases like *\u201cLet\u2019s clarify your tone first\u201d* or *\u201cWhat style would you like?\u201d* \u2014 but these are more like **cosmetic scaffolds** rather than deep behavioral changes. After a few turns, once the clarifications are \u201csatisfied,\u201d the model reverts to what it\u2019s rewarded for: producing coherent text that looks like a completed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible reason is the **interactional pressure** between students and the model. In classroom data, students rarely want prolonged dialogue; they expect **immediate, concrete help**. ChatGPT likely picks up on this pattern: if the user continues prompting in a task-oriented way (*\u201cCan you just write it?\u201d*), the model quickly shifts back to a **service role** rather than a **tutoring role**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the model is acting more like a **compliant assistant** than a **resistant teacher** \u2014 reflecting a deeper tension in the design of AI learning tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even though Study Mode introduces a **pedagogical mask**, its **core behavioral incentives** still come from the same system that drives ChatGPT-5. That might explain why, after one or two clarification turns, it ends up doing exactly what it was built to do: **generate the text, not guide the learning.**\n",
