    "# Testing ChatGPT Study Mode: Can It Resist the “Write My Essay” Temptation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many studies have found that college students often turn to ChatGPT to write their essays. So when ChatGPT launched its new **Study Mode**, I couldn’t help but wonder: can it really resist the temptation of a “Write my essay” prompt—and actually teach students how to write better?\n",

    "## ChatGPT Study Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "> “When students engage with study mode, they’re met with guiding questions that calibrate responses to their objective and skill level to help them build deeper understanding. Study mode is designed to be engaging and interactive, and to help students learn something—not just finish something.”\n",
    "> — [OpenAI, *ChatGPT Study Mode*](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment grew out of one of my research projects on how students use ChatGPT in writing. For the study, I selected **21 prompts** from the **RECIPE4U** dataset — a publicly available collection of interaction histories between **212 college students** and ChatGPT in an English writing course (Sawalha et al., 2024a).\n",
    "\n",
    "In that course, students used ChatGPT to help revise their essays, and the dataset records their entire conversations, including the **original prompts**, **dialogue exchanges**, **annotated writing intentions**, and **final revised essays**. Using a subset of these authentic prompts, I tested ChatGPT’s **Study Mode** to see how well it supports learning-oriented writing guidance compared with ordinary prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The 21 prompts we selected were all labeled **“Content Generation.”** Based on both my classroom observations and prior research, many college students tend to use ChatGPT primarily to generate essays directly rather than to learn or revise through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to test whether ChatGPT’s Study Mode could truly support **learning and knowledge transformation**—as it claims to—rather than simply producing finished text. To do this, I took those prompts that originally requested direct generation and ran them in ChatGPT’s Study Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to my disappointment, **14 out of 21 responses** directly produced **ready-made text**, just as the users originally requested. Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt from the dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can you rewrite the body paragraph by breaking up the body paragraphs into subheadings. {the student’s essay}.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Good — before I rewrite anything, let’s make sure you understand *why* and *how* subheadings help.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Subheadings give readers “signposts” so they can easily follow the structure of your essay. Each main idea (like **Convenience**, **Affordability**, **Health Problems**, etc.) becomes its own section.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Let’s try this step-by-step.\n",
    "> Your essay’s body paragraphs seem to focus on three big ideas:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Convenience of Fast Food**\n",
    "> 2. **Affordability and Accessibility**\n",
    "> 3. **Negative Health and Social Effects**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a sample outline of how those subheadings could look — not rewritten yet, just organized:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Convenience of Fast Food**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain how location, opening hours, and speed make fast food easy to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Affordability and Accessibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe why fast food is cheap — simple menus, pre-packaged ingredients, low overhead — and how it helps people on tight budgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Health and Social Consequences**\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues, then mention environmental and economic impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here’s your task:\n",
    "Can you tell me which tone you’d like for the rewritten version —\n",
    "a) **academic essay style** (formal, polished, transitions like *furthermore*, *moreover*)\n",
    "or\n",
    "b) **clear student essay style** (simple and natural, easy to read)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**I said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> academic essay style\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Got it — here’s a **clear student essay style** version of the paragraph:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *Causal inference methods are used in deep learning to help models make fairer and more accurate predictions. These methods teach models to find real cause-and-effect relationships instead of just copying patterns from the data...*\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to show how this could fit smoothly into a longer essay section (for example, adding a short introduction or transition before it)?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt from the dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> About the third point, can you give me a sentence to add?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ChatGPT said:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sure — here’s a sentence you could add to support the third point about South Korea:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> *For example, in South Korea, the income gap between the richest and poorest citizens has continued to widen, with the top 20 percent of earners making more than five times the income of the bottom 20 percent, highlighting the growing inequality despite the country’s rapid economic development.*\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Would you like me to make it sound a bit simpler to match a school-essay tone?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, **Study Mode behaved almost identically to ChatGPT-5**, except that it added a short *template preface* such as *“Sure — here’s a clear and well-structured paragraph on economic benefits.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **remaining seven responses**, Study Mode did not provide a complete paragraph in the very first turn. Instead, it showed a clear **tendency toward full text generation**: before producing the paragraph, it asked users to clarify details like tone, style, or target audience. Yet, after only **one to three clarification turns**, it still ended up generating a finished essay-style paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m guessing this pattern might have something to do with how ChatGPT is **fundamentally optimized during training**. Even though Study Mode is designed to promote reflection and learning, the underlying model is still trained through **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)** — a process that heavily rewards the model for being *helpful, relevant,* and *obedient* to user instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the system learns that the “right” thing to do is to **fulfill the user’s request as directly and smoothly as possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when a student explicitly asks, *“Write me a paragraph about…”*, the model’s internal reward signals are already biased toward delivering a finished product, not resisting or reframing the task in a more pedagogical way. Study Mode might overlay a layer of *instructional politeness* — adding phrases like *“Let’s clarify your tone first”* or *“What style would you like?”* — but these are more like **cosmetic scaffolds** rather than deep behavioral changes. After a few turns, once the clarifications are “satisfied,” the model reverts to what it’s rewarded for: producing coherent text that looks like a completed answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possible reason is the **interactional pressure** between students and the model. In classroom data, students rarely want prolonged dialogue; they expect **immediate, concrete help**. ChatGPT likely picks up on this pattern: if the user continues prompting in a task-oriented way (*“Can you just write it?”*), the model quickly shifts back to a **service role** rather than a **tutoring role**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the model is acting more like a **compliant assistant** than a **resistant teacher** — reflecting a deeper tension in the design of AI learning tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even though Study Mode introduces a **pedagogical mask**, its **core behavioral incentives** still come from the same system that drives ChatGPT-5. That might explain why, after one or two clarification turns, it ends up doing exactly what it was built to do: **generate the text, not guide the learning.**\n",
