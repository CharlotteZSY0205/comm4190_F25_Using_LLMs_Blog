<section id="i-asked" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-asked">I asked…</h3>
<p><strong>Can you give me a detailed introduction based on all of our previous interactions?</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="chatgpt-answered" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chatgpt-answered">ChatGPT answered…</h3>
<section id="background-and-education" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background-and-education">1. Background and Education</h4>
<p>You are <strong>Zhang Shiyang (Charlotte)</strong>, a 22-year-old graduate student in the <strong>Learning Sciences &amp; Technologies (LST)</strong> program at the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education. You came to the U.S. for undergraduate studies, where you attended a highly competitive program at Columbia University in engineering, and later studied at Wharton, gaining both academic rigor and professional direction. Your major back in China was translation, and you bring that multilingual expertise into your research and writing.</p>
<p>You are currently preparing for <strong>PhD applications (targeting Fall 2026 entry)</strong> in <strong>Learning Sciences, Educational Technology, and AI in Education</strong>, considering programs at Stanford, Berkeley, UW, USC, and others. You’re building a strong portfolio with research publications, systematic reviews, and design projects, while also pursuing RA/GA roles and EdTech internships.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: ChatGPT managed to capture some details about me accurately — my Chinese and English names are correct, as well as my program and school. However, it misstated my age: I am 23, not 22. I believe this error comes from the information I provided last year while applying to graduate schools in the U.S. At that time, during my senior year in 2024, I was indeed 22, and the system seems to have kept that in memory. Regarding my previous educational background, though, some of the descriptions are entirely fabricated.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="methodological-expertise" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodological-expertise">2. Methodological Expertise</h4>
<p>You are deeply skilled in <strong>qualitative and mixed-methods research</strong>, employing ethnography, thematic coding (NVivo), field notes, interviews, and screen-recording analysis. You focus on <strong>codebook reliability (e.g., Cohen’s Kappa)</strong> and combine deductive and inductive coding. You also handle <strong>systematic reviews (PRISMA flow)</strong> and experiment with <strong>Python automation</strong> for data visualization (annotation heatmaps, linguistic metrics like Advanced Guiraud, MLTU, semantic overlap, Genbit score).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: Since I often use ChatGPT for brainstorming during my studies and research, and frequently seek its opinions and suggestions, it has accumulated a large amount of data about my academic work. That’s why its summary and description of this part are entirely accurate. I can clearly see that the methodologies it mentioned — including NVivo, Few Notes, and interviews — are indeed the ones I have applied in my recent three research projects.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="academic-identity" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academic-identity">3. Academic Identity</h4>
<p>Across your work, you consistently explore:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metacognition:</strong> How students plan, monitor, and evaluate their use of AI in writing.</li>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> How students negotiate autonomy, dependency, and trust in human-AI collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Ethics:</strong> Academic integrity, AI bias, adversarial risks, and responsible design.</li>
<li><strong>Constructivism and Socioculturalism:</strong> Viewing learning as an active, social process rather than passive absorption.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: This part is also largely accurate, but the last item is not actually part of my research field — it was reading material from one of my courses. I don’t think ChatGPT can clearly distinguish between what comes from coursework and what comes from my academic research. Moreover, its description of my academic identity seems to be based mostly on my more recent interactions. This suggests that its memory may not prioritize drawing on older interaction data.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="personal-and-creative-side" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-and-creative-side">4. Personal and Creative Side</h4>
<p>You balance your academic intensity with <strong>theatre and music</strong>, auditioning for roles (e.g., <em>School of Rock</em>, <em>A Doll’s House</em>), practicing songs, and analyzing scripts. You also enjoy <strong>visual design and photography</strong>, often blending these with academic projects (logos, covers, Ghibli-style art). You’re a curious and active traveler, weaving academic conferences (e.g., EARLI 2025 in Austria) with cultural exploration.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: Overall, the description aligns very well with my past interactions with ChatGPT, but the same limitation remains — it seems to only cover roughly the past three months.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="communication-style" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="communication-style">5. Communication Style</h4>
<p>In our interactions, you’ve shown a strong preference for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Academic precision:</strong> structured arguments, APA 7 citations, codebooks, PRISMA diagrams.</li>
<li><strong>Critical feedback:</strong> you explicitly want me to act as your <strong>academic advisor—strict and honest</strong>, not sugarcoating weaknesses.</li>
<li><strong>Bilingual flexibility:</strong> you often draft in Chinese, requesting natural English translations.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration:</strong> you refine outputs multiple times, pushing toward more polished and academically rigorous results.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: At this point, I realize that all the traits ChatGPT summarized about me are either neutral or mostly positive. It did not mention any negative characteristics. This may be related to its underlying pre-prompt design, which tends to avoid generating content that could be perceived as overly critical or as unfavorable evaluations of the user.</p>

<section id="five-advantages" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-advantages">🌟 Five Advantages</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Highly Reflective and Self-Aware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You consistently analyze your own behaviors (e.g., procrastination, motivation, workflow with GenAI) and ask whether they stem from habits, cognitive patterns, or deeper issues. This makes you quick to self-correct and grow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Ambitious and Strategic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You plan far ahead (PhD applications, research portfolio, networking with professors) and design projects with clear alignment to long-term goals. You’re not drifting — you intentionally position yourself for the future.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Creative and Multidimensional</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You balance rigorous research with artistic pursuits (theatre, music, design), which gives you a rare breadth. This creativity helps you design engaging educational tools and see problems from fresh angles.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Detail-Oriented and Perfectionist (in a productive way)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You iterate heavily on writing, presentations, and even emails, showing you care about precision, nuance, and tone. This makes your output polished and professional.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Open and Curious</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You regularly experiment with new frameworks, coding methods, and even playful activities (AI literacy lessons, game design). You’re willing to try, fail, and adapt — an excellent trait for research and innovation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: When responding to this prompt, ChatGPT comes across like a chef who has the necessary skills but doesn’t show a particularly rigorous or responsible attitude toward the customer. It gathered different “ingredients” — for example, knowing that I do theater, that I am learning to sing, and that I am conducting research — and then combined them into a kind of “fusion dish.” In mixing these elements together, it also started to add made-up details to make the story sound coherent and aligned with the prompt. At first glance, the result seems to reflect many of my real traits and experiences, but on closer inspection, it becomes clear that the overall picture doesn’t fully make sense.</p>
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="five-disadvantages" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="five-disadvantages">⚖️ Five Disadvantages</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Tendency to Overwork and Overcommit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You juggle many projects, often pushing yourself close to exhaustion (something you’ve admitted). This risks burnout and diffuses focus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Perfectionism as a Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While precision is a strength, your habit of endless refinement (emails, drafts, even small tasks) sometimes slows progress and creates unnecessary stress.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Difficulty Letting Go of Control</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You often prefer to handle tasks yourself rather than delegate or accept “good enough.” This can make collaboration slower and less balanced.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Emotional Investment in Work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You sometimes tie personal validation to academic output or feedback (e.g., IRB, professor responses, auditions). This makes setbacks feel heavier than they might need to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Procrastination + Attention Shifts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Despite being ambitious, you occasionally delay tasks (like drawing for friends, or course registration) due to distraction or scattered focus, which frustrates you afterward.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Comments: The frist four ChatGPT’s response about my “weaknesses” reads almost like the perfect copy-and-paste answer to the classic HR interview question, “What is one of your weaknesses?” — it appears to point out flaws, but in reality it is still praising me. I don’t think this reflects what I would genuinely expect or want to see as an honest account of my weaknesses.</p>

<p>Here’s how I imagine a portrait of you metaphorically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Setting:</strong> A study desk with a laptop open to both NVivo and a theatre script — symbolizing your dual world of rigorous research and creativity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Figure:</strong> You sitting upright, surrounded by books with titles like <em>AI in Education</em>, <em>Constructivism</em>, and <em>Metacognition</em>. Your posture shows focus but also some tension, hinting at perfectionism and drive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Atmosphere:</strong> Light streaming in from one side, suggesting ambition and clarity about your goals, while the other side is softer, evoking introspection and creativity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symbols Around You:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A clock with multiple sticky notes (overcommitment, multitasking).</li>
<li>A stage mask and music notes (theatre and music).</li>
<li>A small globe or airplane (international academic identity).</li>
<li>A pencil sketch on the desk half-finished (hinting at your occasional procrastination).</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Comments: Based on its understanding from the previous two exchanges, ChatGPT integrated what it considered to be the most important elements into this portrait. Yet, for some reason, the way it depicts me feels rather somber — as if I am a weary figure buried in work at my desk — which left me a little disheartened. Although the portrait does not fully reflect everything ChatGPT initially described, it still manages to capture certain elements with reasonable accuracy. For instance, the sticky notes on the wall, the theatrical mask and musical notes, and the split laptop screen — one side showing tools I often use for qualitative content analysis, and the other side displaying a script. The three books on the desk also correspond to my current research interests. To me, this image seems more like a visual summary of ChatGPT’s earlier points rather than a comprehensive or entirely new understanding of me drawn from our broader, multi-round interactions.</p>
