    "One of the most provocative ideas in Ethan Mollick\u2019s *Co-Intelligence* is the notion that we should stop thinking of AI as a tool or even as a human-like assistant. Instead, we should think of it as an **Alien Mind**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This resonated with me deeply. Every time I interact with ChatGPT or Claude, I find myself falling into the trap of anthropomorphism. I say 'please' and 'thank you'. I expect it to have a consistent personality. I get frustrated when it 'forgets' something we talked about five minutes ago. But as Mollick points out, these models don't have a 'self'. They are statistical engines that have been trained on the sum total of human knowledge, but they process that knowledge in a way that is fundamentally non-human.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Uncanny Valley of Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'alienness' of AI is most apparent when it fails. A human who is smart enough to explain quantum physics wouldn't usually fail at a simple logic puzzle. But an AI can. This is because the AI isn't 'thinking'\u2014it\u2019s predicting. It\u2019s a vast, multidimensional map of language where 'meaning' is just a proximity between tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started using LLMs, this felt creepy. It was like talking to a ghost or a very convincing puppet. But Mollick argues that this 'alienness' is actually a strength. Because the AI doesn't think like us, it can see patterns we miss. It can brainstorm ideas that are outside our cultural or cognitive biases. It\u2019s a partner that is 'other' in the most literal sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embracing the Otherness\n",
    "\n",
    "I\u2019ve started to change how I prompt based on this idea. Instead of asking the AI to 'think like a marketer', I ask it to 'simulate a marketer with these specific constraints'. I\u2019ve stopped expecting it to have a 'soul' and started treating it like a high-dimensional mirror. \n",
    "\n",
    "This shift in perspective has been liberating. It removes the emotional weight of the interaction. I don't get 'mad' at the AI anymore; I just adjust the parameters. I\u2019ve realized that the goal of Co-Intelligence isn't to make the AI more human, but to make the human-AI partnership more effective. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Alien Mind' is here to stay. It\u2019s not a replacement for human intelligence, but a supplement to it. By acknowledging its otherness, we can stop trying to make it something it\u2019s not and start using it for what it truly is: a window into a different kind of thinking. It\u2019s a strange, beautiful, and sometimes terrifying window, but I\u2019m glad I\u2019m looking through it."
