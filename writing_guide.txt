# Writing Guide for AI Blog Posts

## 1. Format and Structure
- **File Type**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
- **Metadata**: Every post must start with a `raw` cell containing YAML metadata:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Catchy and Descriptive Title"
  description: "A brief summary of the post's content."
  author: "Shiyang Zhang"
  date: "MM/DD/YYYY"
  categories:
    - Category1
    - Category2
  image: cover_image.jpg
  ---
  ```
- **Headers**: Use `##` for main sections and `###` for subsections.
- **Images**: Center images using HTML:
  ```html
  <div style="display:flex; justify-content:center; align-items:center; gap:16px; width:100%;">
    <img src="image_name.png" width="70%" />
  </div>
  ```
- **Length**: Approximately 500 words per post.

## 2. Writing Style
- **Voice**: First-person ("I", "We", "My").
- **Tone**: Professional yet personal, reflective, and engaging. It should feel like a personal journey of discovery.
- **Content**:
  - Focus on personal thoughts, emotions, and deep reflections.
  - Strong opinions are encouraged.
  - Connect the book's concepts to real-world experiences or AI interactions.
  - Use examples, anecdotes, or "experiments" (like asking an LLM a specific question).
- **Perspective**: The author is a student or practitioner exploring the world of LLMs and AI, specifically through the lens of Ethan Mollick's "Co-Intelligence".

## 3. Content Themes (Ethan Mollick's Co-Intelligence)
- **Co-Intelligence**: The idea of working *with* AI as a partner, not just a tool.
- **The Centaur and the Cyborg**: Different ways of integrating AI into work.
- **The Jagged Frontier**: Understanding where AI excels and where it fails.
- **AI as a Person/Alien**: Treating AI as a creative partner or a strange intelligence.
- **Future of Work/Education**: How AI changes how we learn and work.

## 4. Visuals
- Include at least 2-3 images per post.
- Images should be relevant to the text (e.g., screenshots of AI chats, conceptual diagrams, or related photos).
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `jagged_frontier.png`, `centaur_work.jpg`).
